= Drogue IoT

The Drogue IoT project aims to bring together data and users in an _Internet of Things_ world.

Data comes from sensors and needs to travel a long way to reach its users. Of course, there is also the way back.
All of these steps in the middle are still needed and must be managed in some way.

Drogue IoT provides you with tools, to create safe and efficient IoT solutions. Starting on the embedded side up to
the cloud layer.
