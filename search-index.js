Drogue IoT project aims to bring together data and users in an Internet of Things world. Data comes from sensors and needs to travel a long way to reach its users. Of course, there is also the way back. All of these steps in the middle are still needed and must be managed in some way. Drogue IoT provides you with tools, to create safe and efficient IoT solutions. Starting on the embedded side up to the cloud layer. Drogue Device helps you create safe and efficient applications on microcontroller type of systems. In a world without memory management or operating system it is more important than ever to avoid memory corruption and undefined behavior. That is why Drogue Device is a framework built using the Rust programming language, bringing the promise of Rust to the embedded world: A language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software. — Rust from the Rust Homepage Read more: Drogue Device The edge brings together devices and the cloud side if that is required. If that is just onboarding traffic to an IP-based network, or bringing processing logic closer to devices depends on each use case. Thus edge nodes sometimes look more like a device in some cases, and more like the cloud in others. Drogue IoT currently doesn’t provide any specific edge components. But it ensures that edge devices are part of the system in many different ways. Like having the concept of a \"gateway device\", providing demos on how to run edge workload using containers, integrating with the cloud. The cloud side has different problems to solve: scalability, security, integration. Drogue Cloud tries to make it simple for you to attach devices to a scalable backend. A backend which handles security for you, and integrates with existing technologies and services.

Applications in Drogue IoT cloud scope all elements that belong together. Like devices, data, and integrations. Applications are isolated from each other. Each device is owned by exactly one application and has at least one ID to identify it. Device IDs are unique in the scope of an application. Endpoints, more explicitly protocol endpoints, is where device connect to, in order to communicate with the system. On the device facing side these endpoints implement a device specific protocol, and on the cloud facing side, they communicate using Knative and Cloud Events. A protocol might be a binary protocol, custom to the device. Or also some other higher level API, based on existing communication protocols like MQTT, HTTP, or CoAP. This is sometimes also called: Protocol Adapter South-bound Device-bound Integrations provide ways to integrate your application with the event stream of the system. While integration may support different protocols (like HTTP, MQTT) they should focus on content being encoded as Cloud Events. In general there are two different ways of receiving data through integrations: push or pull. In the case of \"push\", the cloud side of Drogue will try to push events to an endpoint that you define. In the case of \"pull\", you connect to an integration endpoint and subscribe to events you are interested in. Once subscribed, events will be pushed through that communication channel.

However, we do require a few steps before and after the deployment. Installing dependencies on the cluster and setting URLs afterwards. For this we have a magic installer script, that does everything for you. It is suited for an easy start on a local test cluster. The installer package is part of the GitHub release record: https://github.com/drogue-iot/drogue-cloud/releases/latest There is one package for each type of Kubernetes cluster: install-minikube – For using with Minikube install-kind – For using with Kind install-openshift – For using with OpenShift Download the package, matching the cluster you plan to use. Unzip the package and change into the folder extracted from the archive. The installer will create a new instance of Drogue Cloud on the cluster you are currently logged in to. By default, this includes: Installing Strimzi Creating a Kafka cluster Installing the Keycloak operator Create a custom CA for the endpoints If you want to install those dependencies manually, for example using OLM, you can opt-out of the installation (see below). Additionally, it installs Knative and an example application and can install digital twin feature as well. Deployment of these components can be configured using installer arguments as explained below. Run the installer script ./script/drgadm deploy, adding the options appropriate for your setup. You can use the -c argument to define which cluster type you have. Default cluster type By default, the cluster type will be minikube for the script in the repository. For the installers, this default value will be changed to the installer type you downloaded. You can still override the default, using: ./script/drgadm deploy -c kind The deploy command of drgadm supports the following argument -k or INSTALL_DEPS Don’t install any dependency by default. -s Set additional Helm values. May be repeated multiple times. -m Minimize: Reduces the default resource requests to allow deploying on more constrained environments. -d or DOMAIN Manually provide the application DNS domain. -c or CLUSTER Specify the cluster type (any of minikube, kind, openshift, kubernetes). -p Adds an additional Helm value file, named deploy/helm/profiles/.yaml. -t Helm installation timeout (default: 15m) -n or DROGUE_NS Changes the target Drogue IoT namespace. -T Install digital twin feature. -e Don’t install examples. -M Deploy metrics Example: Install Drogue Cloud on kind cluster without dependencies. ./script/drgadm deploy -c kind -k The -k argument will skip installing all dependencies. If you want to install of just some of the dependencies (like Strimzi or Keycloak) yourself, you can opt out of installing them by the script. The installer has a few additional options which are controlled by using environment variables. You can set them by prefixing the call to the installation script, using env and the variable assignment: env INSTALL_STRIMZI=false ./script/drgadm deploy Variable Name Default value Description INSTALL_STRIMZI ${INSTALL_DEPS} Control the installation of Strimzi. INSTALL_KEYCLOAK_OPERATOR ${INSTALL_DEPS} Control the installation of the Keycloak operator. By default the example dashboard is installed by the script. You can turn it off by using -e argument. Additionally, digital twin feature can be installed by specifying -T argument. Knative will be installed only if either examples or digital twin feature are installed. To deploy minimal installation without any examples (and Knative) use: ./script/drgadm deploy -e You can change the namespace where of the Drogue Cloud components get installed using the variable DROGUE_NS. The default is drogue-iot. Currently, you can only change the namespace of the Drogue Cloud installation. The namespaces of Knative, Strimzi, are currently not configurable. By default, the installer script will create a custom certificate authority. However, if you already have a key and certificate, you can instruct the installer to use these. There are two options to achieve this. The installer will check if the secrets http-endpoint-tls, mqtt-endpoint-tls and coap-endpoint-tls exist. If they don’t it will create them using generated key and certificate material. If you manually create these TLS secrets, using those names, before running the installer, it will not override these existing secrets. You can do that by running shell commands similar to these: kubectl -n drogue-iot create secret tls http-endpoint-tls --key $PATH_TO_CERT/tls.key --cert $PATH_TO_CERT/tls.crt --dry-run=client -o json | kubectl -n drogue-iot apply -f - kubectl -n drogue-iot create secret tls mqtt-endpoint-tls --key $PATH_TO_CERT/tls.key --cert $PATH_TO_CERT/tls.crt --dry-run=client -o json | kubectl -n drogue-iot apply -f - kubectl -n drogue-iot create secret tls coap-endpoint-tls --key $PATH_TO_CERT/tls.key --cert $PATH_TO_CERT/tls.crt --dry-run=client -o json | kubectl -n drogue-iot apply -f - Where $PATH_TO_CERT should point to the path location of your certificate. Should something go wrong, it should be possible to just re-run the installer script. That should simply set the desired state again, and Kubernetes should reconcile accordingly. In most of the cases, this works just fine. After the installer script has run, it will show some information on how you can connect to the system and give some example commands to try out.","title":"Installer script","component":"drogue-cloud","version":"dev","name":"installer","url":"/drogue-cloud/dev/deployment/installer.html","titles":[{"text":"Download the installer package","hash":"_download_the_installer_package","id":1},{"text":"Unpacking","hash":"_unpacking","id":2},{"text":"What to expect","hash":"_what_to_expect","id":3},{"text":"Running the installer","hash":"_running_the_installer","id":4},{"text":"Additional installer options","hash":"_additional_installer_options","id":5},{"text":"Skip the dependency installation","hash":"_skip_the_dependency_installation","id":6},{"text":"Install additional examples","hash":"_install_additional_examples","id":7},{"text":"Change the target namespace","hash":"_change_the_target_namespace","id":8},{"text":"Provide custom TLS certificates","hash":"_provide_custom_tls_certificates","id":9},{"text":"Manually create the TLS secrets","hash":"_manually_create_the_tls_secrets","id":10},{"text":"Re-running the installer","hash":"_re_running_the_installer","id":11},{"text":"Status information","hash":"_status_information","id":12}]},"9":{"id":9,"text":"Specifying -M during installation process will install Prometheus and Grafana allowing you to monitor your deployment.

While the system has a single sign-on system for the user facing services, devices, especially embedded devices, are more limited and using OAuth tokens might not be a good fit. In general, devices have different usage patterns when it comes to authentication and authorization. Open ID connect and OAuth are designed with a strong focus on HTTP. Which is great, when it comes to authenticate users using browsers and REST clients, but becomes a burden when embedded systems and protocols like MQTT and CoAP come into play. Drogue Cloud tries to make it as easy as possible for devices to connect to the cloud side, and so we believe that technologies like pre-shared keys, X.509 client certificates, or simple \"username/password\" credentials are a better fit for devices. Still, for user/application facing application we use Open ID connect, as you can read in Single sign-on. A PostgreSQL compatible database is used to persist the information. The device registry component consists of several services, which provides internal and external APIs to access the data stored in this database. (Device) Management API Allows external access to the application and device information. This is a REST API, which allows using management tools and applications to create, edit, delete, and view data stored inside the device registry. User Auth Service Allows internal applications to check if a user has access to a requested resource. This is for example used by the web frontend, to ensure a user may use the \"message spy\" to access messages of this application. Or by the management API to check if a user may perform the requested operation on a resource. This service works with read-only access to the database, and can work with a ready-only slave replica. Device Auth Service Allows internal application to authenticate and authorize a device. For example, this service is being used by the protocol endpoints, to grant devices access for publishing data to the system. Validating credentials like passwords or X.509 client certificates. Once authenticated, it also reports backs additional device configuration for the endpoints, like core mapping information for the LoRaWAN \"function ports\". This service works with read-only access to the database, and can work with a ready-only slave replica. In addition to the management API, which allows getting/reading information out of the registry, the registry will also send \"change events\", when resources get modified. This is again built on top of Knative eventing, and allows services to act on the modification of applications and devices. Using this concept, it is possible to implement \"controllers\" (or \"operators\"), which reconcile the desired state of a resource. One example of this, is the \"The Things Network\" (TTN) controller, which detects a TTN specific section in the device configuration, and then tries to create an appropriate device in a linked TTN instance. Currently, this functionality is considered \"internal\", and such change events cannot be consumed from outside the system. Drogue Cloud has a single sign-on (SSO) service, which by default is implemented by Keycloak. As mentioned before, the SSO service is used to authenticate users and applications, not devices. It is also used internally, to manage access between the internal services. The authorization however, the check if a user has access to a device or application, is handled by the \"user auth service\", which is backed by the device registry. The SSO service is also used in order to integrate other services, like the Eclipse Ditto based digital twin service, or the example Grafana Dashboard.","title":"Control plane","component":"drogue-cloud","version":"dev","name":"control","url":"/drogue-cloud/dev/introduction/control.html","titles":[{"text":"Device registry","hash":"_device_registry","id":1},{"text":"Provided services","hash":"_provided_services","id":2},{"text":"Change events for integration","hash":"_change_events_for_integration","id":3},{"text":"Single sign-on","hash":"_single_sign_on","id":4}]},"14":{"id":14,"text":"A core feature of Drogue Cloud is the abstraction of protocols. Typical IoT protocols are MQTT, CoAP, OPC UA, but also HTTP is being used by some devices. Ideally, your cloud side application only needs to think about implementing one protocol, in order to interact with your devices. However, different IoT protocols provide benefits on the device side. As the devices are more constrained than the cloud side, Drogue Cloud tries to levarage the benefits of IoT protocols, while providing a normalization layer on the cloud side, that makes it easy for your applications to consume the data. But also on the cloud side, different ways to consume data exists. May that be a direct connection to a Kafka topic, again MQTT, or a simple Web socket connection. Drogue Cloud tries to be integrate as good as possible, and not force you into a specific API. Drogue Cloud is based on Knative, and internally uses the Cloud Events specification to forward messages. Cloud events on the other side have different mappings to transport channels, such as MQTT, Kafka, HTTP, etc.. And while Cloud Events can also be used on the external interfaces of Drogue Cloud, it isn’t a requirement, and you can use your custom protocols as you need. Devices communicate with the Protocol endpoints, which implement the protocol specific mapping between the actual protocol and the internal Cloud Events based message format. The protocol endpoints also authenticates and authorizes devices and its configured gateways. Validate credentials, or X.509 client certificates and ensure that the devices are enabled in the system. Once the device is granted access to publish (or receive) data, the protocol endpoint will hook up the device to the internal message flow. It subscribes to commands targeted towards the device, and forwards messages from the device to an internal Knative eventing endpoint which takes care of processing and delivering the messgaes. The actual payload of the messages is not processed, and just passed on the Knative eventing destination. In some cases the payload of an incoming request is not equal to the payload of the actual message. For example, a request from \"The Things Network\" (TTN) consists of a payload, which contains meta data (like the device ID), and then the actual payload of the original message from the device. In cases like this it depends on the protocol adapter what it considers payload and what is metadata. In the case of TTN, you can configure if you want to have the full request payload, or just the original device payload. When a protocol endpoint drops off an incoming message to the Knative eventing service, this service is backed by a Kafka topic[1]. The responsibility of Kafka is to deliver messages to the target consumer. Persisting messages if needed, and handling shared consumer groups if requested. This allows Drogue Cloud to buffer messages when the consumer is unavailable or if there is a peak of messages that the consumer currently cannot handle. Also, this allows to drive a shared consumer model, where in a group of consumers only one receives a messages. This concept is used to share the load for messages to multiple instances of a consumer. As mentioned before, Drogue Cloud relies on a Knative eventing destination which provides these guarantees, and uses Kafka to implement this. However, it is possible to replace the Kafka implementation with a different implementation. Applications, like devices, are provided by the user and live outside of the Drogue Cloud instance. They still may run on the same cluster. By \"consuming\" messages, we mean that messages, sent by a device, are forwarded to the target application. It also implies a channel back to the device, for sending commands. However, as device-to-cloud messages are much more frequent, we simply focus on \"consuming\" messages. In general there are \"push\" or \"pull\" modes. Messages are always sent to the consumer in an event oriented manner, \"push\" and \"pull\" only refers on who initiates the process. Push model A sender service inside the Drogue Cloud instance constantly tries to reach out to a target destination, trying to deliver messages. This might be a Knative eventing service, which tries to deliver messages from the Kafka topic to an HTTP endpoint. Pull mode A passive service inside the Drogue Cloud instance that waits for a consumer to connect. Once the consumer connected successfully, messages start to flow. This might be an MQTT server, which publishes messages to the consumer once it subscribed. Authentication (authn) and authorization (authz) happens in two different realms[2] of the system. On the device facing side and on the user/application facing side. And while it may be technically incorrect, in the next few paragraphs \"authentication\" implies authentication and authorization, unless noted otherwise. The device facing authentication is backed by the device registry, which is the central storage for device information and configuration. It also stores credentials of devices, like passwords or X.509 trust anchors. The user facing authentication is backed by an Open ID connect, single sign-on system. By default we use Keycloak, however it should be possible to use any other Open ID connect compatible solution. Services internally also use the same SSO solution as external users. 1. Technically it is a Knative eventing service, which could be implemented by different technologies. The default implementation for Drogue Cloud though is Kafka. 2.

However, what we actually mean is: devices, gateways, and services. Device A device, directly connected to Drogue Cloud. This may be an embedded device, or a more powerful compute node with a full blown operating system. It may also be a containerized application, running inside an Edge node, connecting to Drogue Cloud. Gateway A device, which acts as a proxy for other devices, that may not directly connect to Drogue Cloud. This may be some kind of Linux machine, which allows non-IP enabled devices, like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices, to connect to Drogue Cloud, by forwarding messages between the two protocols. Services In some cases a gateway is not a single device, but a bigger, maybe cloud based, service as well. Still it acts as a proxy for devices to communicate with Drogue Cloud. An example might be \"The Things Network\" (TTN), or \"Sigfox\". Both services have their own technical infrastructure to which devices connect. These services act as a proxy to their devices. From a Drogue Cloud perspective such services are \"gateways\" as well. It may be, that between Drogue Cloud and the actual device, additional \"gateways\", like a LoRaWAN gateway, are in place. A LoRa device might connect to its local gateway, which connects to the TTN network, which then connects to Drogue Cloud. However, for Drogue Cloud only the device which directly connects (TTN service) and the originating device (the actual device) is important. Intermediate gateways may be in play, but are not relevant.","title":"Devices, Gateways & Services","component":"drogue-cloud","version":"dev","name":"devices","url":"/drogue-cloud/dev/introduction/devices.html","titles":[]},"16":{"id":16,"text":"The main purpose of Drogue IoT cloud is to connect applications with devices.

This can be configured using the structure ExternalEndpoint. This is normally embedded in some other structure. The following examples will assume that there is a field named endpoint, which should define the external endpoint. The role of the endpoint is specific to the actual location of the configuration. This section simply describes the common configuration options. The most simple configuration is: endpoint: url: https://my-external/endpoint By default, the functionality using an external endpoint will use a reasonable HTTP method for making the request. However, you can override the method using the following field: endpoint: url: https://my-external/endpoint method: GET (1) 1 Must be a valid HTTP method, using uppercase only. If the remote endpoint requires authentication, you can configure HTTP \"basic auth\" like this: endpoint: url: https://my-external/endpoint auth: basic: username: my-username password: my-password Or a \"bearer token\" using: endpoint: url: https://my-external/endpoint auth: bearer: token: my-token It is also possible to add additional HTTP header like so: endpoint: url: https://my-external/endpoint headers: - my-foo-header: my-foo-value By default, the functionality using an external endpoint will use a reasonable default timeout for making the request. However, you can override the timeout using the following field: endpoint: url: https://my-external/endpoint timeout: 1s (1) 1 Timeout duration in a format described in Defining durations By default, system default TLS settings will be used.

Currently, the endpoint does not support DTLS. It is not recommended to use this in production or to transfer any sensitive data over public networks. Before communicating with the endpoint, the respective device and application need to be registered with drogue cloud. The coap requests made to the endpoint need to be of the following format: coap:///v1/{channel}/{subject(optional)} The UriPath option should be set with v1, channel name and subject name(optional). Optional parameters can also be passed, but they need to be URL encoded. The rules for encoding the device and application name can be viewed over here. The following parameters can be passed as queries: application: The specific application ID that the device is sending telemetry to device: The device ID data_schema: Data schema of the payload as: Allows the device to alias another ID ct: The amount of time the device will wait for incoming commands For a device to receive commands, it must send a request with a specified timeout. The command will piggyback on the response—the responsibility to track when the device issues a request and promptly issue the command lies on the application. Authentication information is sent using the CoAP option number 4209. It is carried out using HTTP-like authentication headers. For example: Basic ZGV2aWNlMUBhcHAxOmhleS1yb2RuZXk Here, we use the HTTP Basic authentication scheme, along with the base64 encoded device authentication information. The format of the device authentication information is @:. A sample CoAP request would look something like the following: The Request URL would be formatted like so, with the device name 'device#2' and 'device#4' percentage encoded: coap://test-url/v1/sample_channel/sample_subject?application=app1&device=device%232&data_schema=application%2Foctet-stream&as=device%232&ct=30 The value of Option 4209, representing auth information \"device1@app1:hey-rodney\": Basic ZGV2aWNlMUBhcHAxOmhleS1yb2RuZXk // present as bytes Value of the UriPath Option(obtained from request URL): v1, Rust, test // present as bytes Value of the UriQuery Option(obtained from request URL): // present as bytes application=app1&device=device%232&data_schema=application%2Foctet-stream&as=device%234&ct=30 There are two response types that a device can receive. A device would receive a response with the 2.04(Changed) status code if the publish action were successful. If the request passed the ct(command timeout) parameter and a command is sent to the device within this interval, the device will receive the 2.05(Content) response code. The contents of the command can then be read from the CoAP option 4210. If a request fails, the device can receive responses with appropriate status codes.

This is not an MQTT broker It is important to understand, that the MQTT endpoint is not a general purpose MQTT broker. It is an MQTT based API, providing access to Drogue Cloud specific functionality, using the MQTT protocol and existing MQTT tools. As MQTT is a long-lived connection, it makes sense to use it in gateway device use-cases. In this case, a device connects to the MQTT endpoint, and then also performs operations for other devices (connected via the gateway) device. Drogue Cloud supports this model. Basically every device connecting via MQTT can act as a gateway device. The devices which allow other devices to act on their behalf, must indicate this by explicitly selecting a device as their gateway. This is done using the device configuration on the device: metadata: name: sensor01 (1) application: my-app spec: credentials: {} (2) gatewaySelector: matchNames: (3) - gateway01 1 Name of the actual device. 2 Empty credentials, as this device doesn’t need to allow a direct connection. 3 Names of the devices (gateways) which are allowed to act on behalf of this device. A device can act both as direct device and as gateway a the same time. Clean session must be true You may use X.509 client certificates when establishing the TLS connection.The certificate must be signed with a trust anchor stored in the device registry on the application level. Use @ and a configured password for the device. The MQTT endpoint supports different \"dialects\" or APIs.The following subsections describe these dialects.By default, the \"Drogue V1\" dialect is use. However, you can configure the dialect of a device through the application or device configuration: see MQTT dialects. The Drogue V1 dialect is the original one, which supports all the features that Drogue Cloud offers using the MQTT endpoint. To publish data as the connected device, publish to . The channel information will be encoded in the subject header of the generated event. To publish data on behalf of another device, publish to /. If the connected device is not listed as the specified device. The message will be dropped (QoS 0) or rejected (QoS 1). The payload of the publish message will be the \"data\" of the generated event. For MQTT v5, it is possible to set the \"content type\" property, which will be used as the content type for the generated event. By default (for MQTT 3.1.1, or when the content type is not provided), the content-type will be evaluated. If the payload can be successfully parsed as JSON, the content type will be application/json. Otherwise it will be application/octet-stream. In general, the command topic structure is command/inbox//. It is however not possible to subscribe to specific commands only. Topic pattern Example topic Description command/inbox//# command/inbox//set-temp Subscribe to commands for the actual device command/inbox/my-device/# command/inbox/my-device/set-temp Subscribe to commands for the device my-device. command/inbox/# command/inbox/+/# command/inbox/my-device/set-temp command/inbox//set-temp Subscribe to commands for actual device and all devices it acts as a gateway for. The payload of the command, will be the payload of the received message. The \"plain topic\" dialect doesn’t impose any restrictions on the topic naming that devices publish to. So it is ideal for connecting existing clients via MQTT, without the need to change the publish topic structure. The downside is, that additional information (like sending on behalft of another device) which could go in the topic structure, now cannot be assigned a special meaning. The topic the client publishes to will directly be used as the channel information. If the \"device prefix\" option is enabled, then the first segment of the topic will always be used a device ID. The connected device will only act as a gateway. The same access rules apply as for all gateways and devices.

The service supports both MQTT v3.1.1 and MQTT 5. It is possible to use anonymous authentication. This may severely limit access to data, but in some special cases, this may be a viable use case. You can use the OAuth2 access token of your user as either username or password (not both at the same time!). When using MQTT v3.1.1, you must pass the token as the username, as this version of MQTT doesn’t allow to send a password only. Token expiration OAuth2 access tokens are only valid for a short amount of time. You need to provide a non-expired access token in order to log in. For this, you most likely need to refresh the token before every connection attempt. An alternative is to use API keys instead. When providing a username and a password, the username must be the name of your user, and the password must be an API key created for that user. In order to subscribe to events, subscribe using the following filter: app/. So to subscribe to example-app, you need to subscribe to app/example-app. The default data format follows the MQTT binding for CloudEvents using the \"structured content mode\", which includes all information, metadata and actual payload, as part of the MQTT payload. When using MQTT 5, you can request the service to send events in the \"binary content mode\", which encodes the metadata as part of the MQTT user properties. In this case, the MQTT payload is equal to the actual CloudEvents payload. As this encoding make use of \"user properties\", it is not available when using MQTT v3.1.1. By default, each MQTT subscriber uses its own Kafka consumer group, and thus receives each message. However, you can use MQTT shared subscriptions to define a shared consumer group, which maps to using the same Kafka consumer group on the backend. In this case, only one of the consumers will receive a message. To subscribe using shared subscriptions, use the following subscription filter: $share//app/. So when subscribing to the application my-app with the shared consumer identifier my-group, you would use: $share/my-group/app/my-app. You can send back a command to a device by publishing to the following topic: command///. For example, sending the command setTemperature with payload {\"value\": 1.23 } to the device my-device of the application my-app, you would need to publish the payload {\"value\": 1.23 } to the topic command/my-app/my-device/setTemperature.

On top of that, one needs to define an API. Some might disagree and say that you can just publish anything to an MQTT broker. However, implicitly, you have to agree (even when only working with your own components) to a data format and topic structure. As Drogue Cloud is payload agnostic, we don’t interfere or interpret the payload itself[1]. However, we sometimes need to interpret the metadata of events and messages, like the topic a client publishes or subscribes to. The MQTT endpoint supports multiple dialects. However, it also needs to know which dialect a device \"speaks\". Using MQTT v5, it would be easy to add some property during the connection phase, to indicate which dialect the device expects. However, as MQTT v3.1.1 still seems to be the dominant protocol version, that isn’t possible[2]. That is why Drogue Cloud keeps this configuration as part of the application or device configuration. The advantage of that is also, that it can be centrally managed. Just assume some protocol setting of your device, which is somewhere out in the field, is wrong. Being able to correct that in the cloud, might be beneficial. The configuration for MQTT dialects is located in either the application or device resource at .spec.mqtt.dialect. The configuration of a device will override the configuration of an application. If neither the application nor the device has any configuration, the drogue/v1 dialect will be used. spec: mqtt: dialect: type: plainTopic (1) devicePrefix: true (2) 1 Selects the dialect. 2 Additional options on the same level. The follow section describes the configuration of the different dialects. To get an understanding of the different dialects themselves, see Protocol dialects. The type ID for this dialect is: drogue/v1. This dialect does not have any additional options. The type ID for this dialect is: plainTopic. Option Type Default Description devicePrefix boolean false Whether the first segment in the topic is interpreted as device ID. 1. With a few exceptions 2. At least all ways of stuffing information in e.g. credentials fields somehow feels wrong","title":"MQTT dialects","component":"drogue-cloud","version":"dev","name":"management-mqtt","url":"/drogue-cloud/dev/user-guide/management-mqtt.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"Basic configuration","hash":"_basic_configuration","id":2},{"text":"Dialects","hash":"_dialects","id":3},{"text":"Drogue V1","hash":"_drogue_v1","id":4},{"text":"Plain topic","hash":"_plain_topic","id":5}]},"33":{"id":33,"text":"One core functionality of Drogue Cloud is to take device events and send deliver them to a Kafka topic, so that interested application can consume them. In that process, Drogue Cloud takes care of device connectivity, authentication & authorization, and some very basic validation steps. However, most of that processing is payload agnostic. By default, payload and metadata just forwarded as is. In some cases it would be helpful though, if metadata or payload could be altered of verified with additional logic during the reception of the event. What might come in handy in situation like this, is a rule based engine, which allows inspecting metadata and payload and decide how to process the event further. Rejecting, diverting, or altering it in the process. However, such a system can get out of hand pretty quickly, and we do not want to re-invent the wheel. A lot of systems like that already exists: Apache Camel for example, to mention just one of them. Also, allowing a user to configure a complex piece of logic for a cloud side, \"as a service\" platform can be rather tricky. Just imagine someone would validate \"what the next matching bitcoin hash\" is. It would be difficult to measure and project the costs caused by user provided validations. So Drogue Cloud tries to strike a balance. Support very simple and stateless operations, while allowing to integrate for more complex operations, hosted by the user. Just two quick examples: Drogue Cloud does offer a way to overwrite the \"content type\" attribute for an event if its channels matches a specific value. But for letting an AI/ML model categorize values of an even, we allow passing the event into an external endpoint, and consume it back as the response, before passing it along the chain. This way you can spin up your own (optionally Knative serving based) endpoint, and do complex calculations there, but do all of this as part of the Drogue Cloud device facing endpoints. The functionality is configured as part of the \"application\" resource in the .spec.publish path. The configuration consists of two main parts: rules which select when operations get triggered what operations should be performed when a rule matches Overall, even pre-processing will iterate over all rules, as defined in the order of the configuration and check if a rule matches. If it does, its operations will be executed. The outcome of an operation can one of: continue, accept, reject, drop. When the outcome is to continue, the event might have been modified, and the processing will continue with the next rule to check. When the outcome is to accept, the event might have been modified, the processing will stop, and the event will directly be delivered to the final destination. When the outcome is to reject, the event will be rejected as invalid, responding this condition to the device that sent the event, in case the device waits for a response. When the outcome is to drop, the event will be silently dropped. Towards the device, the operation is still successful. spec: publish: rules: - when: {} (1) then: [] (2) 1 One object which defines if the rule should be activated 2 An array of operations which should be executed when the rule matches You can use the isChannel matcher. For example: when: isChannel: my-channel (1) 1 The name of the channel which the event must match You can invert the outcome of a check using the not operation: when: not: isChannel: my-channel This checks if \"the channel is not `my-channel`\". A rule that always matches is always. when: always You can also turn this into \"never\" using the following: when: not: always It is also possible to use multiple checks and combined them with and or or: when: or: - isChannel: foo - isChannel: bar - isChannel: baz Which would match if the channel is either foo, bar, or baz. When an or or and check has no sub-checks, it evaluates to false. Operations are part of the then field, which is an array. All operations will be executed in order. The outcome of an operation may influence the processing of the next. If the array is empty, then simply no operations will be executed. You can silently drop the event using drop: then: drop Or accept the event directly, and stop processing following operations and rules: then: - break Rejecting the event will also stop processing, but return the provided reason back to the sender: then: - reject: This is not right It also is possible to set or remove cloud event attributes or extensions. Cloud event attributes are similar to extensions, they are just extensions that are part of the official specification and thus are treated differently. You can set or remove arbitrary extensions using: then: - setExtension: (1) name: my-ext value: my-value - removeExtension: my-other-ext (2) 1 Set extension my-ext to value my-value 2 Remove extension my-other-ext Setting an extension which already exists will overwrite the value. Removing an extension that does not exist is a no-op. As attributes are somewhat special it is only possible to set some of them. The following attributes are supported and can be set similar to the setExtension operation: datacontenttype - The content type of the event, e.g. application/json dataschema - The schema of the data, e.g. some JSON schema if the content type is JSON subject - The subject of the event, originally the \"channel\" information type - The type of the event, originally io.drogue.event.v1 This will send an event to an external endpoint and wait for the response. HTTP status code Outcome Description 200, 204 Continue The event can continue processing 202 Accept The event gets directly accepted. No further procesing is performed. 400..=499 Reject The event gets rejected.

All management operations are available through the API. However, for an easier getting started experience, the following examples will use the command line tool drg for performing the operations. All following examples require that you are already logged in to a Drogue Cloud cluster using the command line tool drg. An application is the container for devices.A user can have multiple applications, but each device belongs to a single application. Create a new application using the following command: drg create app my-app This will create a new application named my-app. If the application name is already used, you will receive an error, as application names are unique. Applications are defined by a JSON structure. It is possible to edit this structure in YAML format (for easier editing) using the following command: drg edit app my-app This will open an editor, and allow you to make modifications to the YAML source. When you close the editor, the change will be sent to the server for updating. An existing application can be deleted using the following command: drg delete app my-app Deleting an application may be delayed, as first all devices which require to be cleaned up will be processed. Once this is finished, the application might require cleanup too. Only once all resources are properly cleaned up, the application will be actually deleted. As devices belong to an application, you need to create an application first. The following commands will explicitly select the application by providing the --app argument. You can however use drg config set-default-app, to set a default application and omit the --app argument. A new device is being created using the following command: drg create device --app my-app my-device-1 This will create my-device-1 as part of my-app. In most cases a device will require additional information, like access credentials or gateway assignments. You can provide initial configuration using the --spec argument: drg create device --app my-app my-device-1 --spec '{\"credentials\": {\"credentials\":[{ \"pass\": \"foobar\" }]}}' The --spec argument accepts a JSON string of the full \"spec\" section of the device. You can edit the device configuration in YAML the same as the application: drg edit device --app my-app my-device-1 This will open an editor, and allow you to make modifications to the YAML source. When you close the editor, the change will be sent to the server for updating. An existing device can be deleted using the following command: drg delete device --app my-app my-device-1 If a device requires any cleanup, the device will be first marked as deleted, the cleanup will be processed, and then the device will be deleted. It is possible to set a password as access credentials. This way, when connecting, the username will be the device name. You have created a device Configure the device, adding a password credentials entry: metadata: name: device # … spec: # … credentials: credentials: - pass: my-password (1) 1 One credential entry of type \"password\". You can also use hashed passwords. For this, you need to specify the hash algorithm: metadata: name: device # … spec: # … credentials: credentials: - pass: bcrypt: \"$2a$12$WsLmgORBv3WHZ3CjCiMzXOeo2hL5UEeq8PEd11q9BfbM/RWqb7c3G\" (1) 1 One credential entry of type \"password\" as \"bcrypt\" hash. See Supported hashes for a list of supported password hashes. It is also possible to set a username and password as credentials. In this case, the device ID must be transmitted through an alternate way, in order to look up the device. The provided username/password combination will then be checked against the configured username/password combination. The way the device name is transmitted to the endpoint depends on the capabilities of the protocol endpoint. For example, using HTTP, the device name can be provided as an additional query parameter. You have created a device Configure the device, adding a password credentials entry: metadata: name: device (1) # … spec: # … credentials: credentials: - user: username: device-user (2) password: bar (3) 1 The device name 2 The username 3 The plain text password You can also use hashed passwords, instead of plain text: metadata: name: device (1) # … spec: # … credentials: credentials: - user: username: device-user (2) password: bcrypt: \"$2a$12$WsLmgORBv3WHZ3CjCiMzXOeo2hL5UEeq8PEd11q9BfbM/RWqb7c3G\" (3) 1 The device name 2 The username 3 The bcrypt hashed password See Supported hashes for a list of supported password hashes. If you want to use the username only for authenticating your device, without the need to provide an additional device identifier, you can use \"unique usernames\". These usernames are unique per application. You have created a device Configure the device, adding a password credentials entry: metadata: name: device # … spec: # … credentials: credentials: - user: username: device-user password: bar unique: true (1) 1 Setting the value to true makes the entry a unique username entry. As described in Setting username/password credentials, you can use hashed passwords too. Every device can act as a gateway for another device. However, it must be granted the permission to act on behalf of that other device. The way this is done, is by adding this information to the device connects through a gateway. You have created two devices. One that should act as gateway (named gateway in the following steps). One that should act as the actual device (named sensor in the following steps). The gateway device has access credentials configured, so that the gateway can connect to the cloud. In the configuration of the actual device, select the devices that can act as a gateway: metadata: name: sensor # … spec: # … gatewaySelector: matchNames: - gateway It is possible to use one or more devices as gateway. It is possible to store passwords either plain text or hashed.

Applications in Drogue IoT cloud scope all elements that belong together. Like devices, data, and integrations. Applications are isolated from each other. Each device is owned by exactly one application and has at least one ID to identify it. Device IDs are unique in the scope of an application. Endpoints, more explicitly protocol endpoints, is where device connect to, in order to communicate with the system. On the device facing side these endpoints implement a device specific protocol, and on the cloud facing side, they communicate using Knative and Cloud Events. A protocol might be a binary protocol, custom to the device. Or also some other higher level API, based on existing communication protocols like MQTT, HTTP, or CoAP. This is sometimes also called: Protocol Adapter South-bound Device-bound Integrations provide ways to integrate your application with the event stream of the system. While integration may support different protocols (like HTTP, MQTT) they should focus on content being encoded as Cloud Events. In general there are two different ways of receiving data through integrations: push or pull. In the case of \"push\", the cloud side of Drogue will try to push events to an endpoint that you define. In the case of \"pull\", you connect to an integration endpoint and subscribe to events you are interested in. Once subscribed, events will be pushed through that communication channel.

This is considered an example, and allows to quickly try out Drogue Cloud services.

While the system has a single sign-on system for the user facing services, devices, especially embedded devices, are more limited and using OAuth tokens might not be a good fit. In general, devices have different usage patterns when it comes to authentication and authorization. Open ID connect and OAuth are designed with a strong focus on HTTP. Which is great, when it comes to authenticate users using browsers and REST clients, but becomes a burden when embedded systems and protocols like MQTT and CoAP come into play. Drogue Cloud tries to make it as easy as possible for devices to connect to the cloud side, and so we believe that technologies like pre-shared keys, X.509 client certificates, or simple \"username/password\" credentials are a better fit for devices. Still, for user/application facing application we use Open ID connect, as you can read in Single sign-on. A PostgreSQL compatible database is used to persist the information. The device registry component consists of several services, which provides internal and external APIs to access the data stored in this database. (Device) Management API Allows external access to the application and device information. This is a REST API, which allows using management tools and applications to create, edit, delete, and view data stored inside the device registry. User Auth Service Allows internal applications to check if a user has access to a requested resource. This is for example used by the web frontend, to ensure a user may use the \"message spy\" to access messages of this application. Or by the management API to check if a user may perform the requested operation on a resource. This service works with read-only access to the database, and can work with a ready-only slave replica. Device Auth Service Allows internal application to authenticate and authorize a device. For example, this service is being used by the protocol endpoints, to grant devices access for publishing data to the system. Validating credentials like passwords or X.509 client certificates. Once authenticated, it also reports backs additional device configuration for the endpoints, like core mapping information for the LoRaWAN \"function ports\". This service works with read-only access to the database, and can work with a ready-only slave replica. In addition to the management API, which allows getting/reading information out of the registry, the registry will also send \"change events\", when resources get modified. This is again built on top of Knative eventing, and allows services to act on the modification of applications and devices. Using this concept, it is possible to implement \"controllers\" (or \"operators\"), which reconcile the desired state of a resource. One example of this, is the \"The Things Network\" (TTN) controller, which detects a TTN specific section in the device configuration, and then tries to create an appropriate device in a linked TTN instance. Currently, this functionality is considered \"internal\", and such change events cannot be consumed from outside the system. Drogue Cloud has a single sign-on (SSO) service, which by default is implemented by Keycloak. As mentioned before, the SSO service is used to authenticate users and applications, not devices. It is also used internally, to manage access between the internal services. The authorization however, the check if a user has access to a device or application, is handled by the \"user auth service\", which is backed by the device registry. The SSO service is also used in order to integrate other services, like the Eclipse Ditto based digital twin service, or the example Grafana Dashboard.","title":"Control plane","component":"drogue-cloud","version":"0.4","name":"control","url":"/drogue-cloud/0.4/architecture/control.html","titles":[{"text":"Device registry","hash":"_device_registry","id":1},{"text":"Provided services","hash":"_provided_services","id":2},{"text":"Change events for integration","hash":"_change_events_for_integration","id":3},{"text":"Single sign-on","hash":"_single_sign_on","id":4}]},"39":{"id":39,"text":"A core feature of Drogue Cloud is the abstraction of protocols. Typical IoT protocols are MQTT, CoAP, OPC UA, but also HTTP is being used by some devices. Ideally, your cloud side application only needs to think about implementing one protocol, in order to interact with your devices. However, different IoT protocols provide benefits on the device side. As the devices are more constrained than the cloud side, Drogue Cloud tries to levarage the benefits of IoT protocols, while providing a normalization layer on the cloud side, that makes it easy for your applications to consume the data. But also on the cloud side, different ways to consume data exists. May that be a direct connection to a Kafka topic, again MQTT, or a simple Web socket connection. Drogue Cloud tries to be integrate as good as possible, and not force you into a specific API. Drogue Cloud is based on Knative, and internally uses the Cloud Events specification to forward messages. Cloud events on the other side have different mappings to transport channels, such as MQTT, Kafka, HTTP, etc.. And while Cloud Events can also be used on the external interfaces of Drogue Cloud, it isn’t a requirement, and you can use your custom protocols as you need. Devices communicate with the Protocol endpoints, which implement the protocol specific mapping between the actual protocol and the internal Cloud Events based message format. The protocol endpoints also authentication and authorize devices and its configured gateways. Validate credentials, or X.509 client certificates and ensure that the devices are enabled in the system. Once the device is granted access to publish (or receive) data, the protocol endpoint will hook up the device to the internal message flow. It subscribes to commands targeted towards the device, and forwards messages from the device to an internal Knative eventing endpoint which takes care of processing and delivering the messgaes. The actual payload of the messages is not processed, and just passed on the Knative eventing destination. In some cases the payload of an incoming request is not equal to the payload of the actual message. For example, a request from \"The Things Network\" (TTN) conists of a payload, which contains meta data (like the device ID), and then the actual payload of the original message from the device. In cases like this it depends on the protocol adapter what it considers payload and what is metadata. In the case of TTN, you can configure if you want to have the full request payload, or just the original device payload. When a protocol endpoint drops off an incoming message to the Knative eventing service, this service is backed by a Kafka topic[1]. The responsibility of Kafka is to deliver messages to the target consumer. Peristing messages if needed, and handling shared consumer groups if requested. This allows Drogue Cloud to buffer messages when the consumer is unavailable or of there is a peak of messages that the consumer currently cannot handle. Also, this allows to drive a shared consumer model, where in a group of consumers only one receives a messages. This concept is used to share the load for messages to multiple instances of a consumer. As mentioned before, Drogue Cloud relies on a Knative eventing destination which provides these guarantees, and uses Kafka to implement this. However, it is possible to replace the Kafka implementation with a different implementation. Applications, like devices, are provided by the user and live outside of the Drogue Cloud instance. They still may run on the same cluster. By \"consuming\" messages, we mean that messages, sent by a device, are forwarded to the target application. It also implies a channel back to the device, for sending commands. However, as device-to-cloud messages are much more frequent, we simply focus on \"consuming\" messages. In general there are \"push\" or \"pull\" modes. Messages are always sent to the consumer in an event oriented manner, \"push\" and \"pull\" only refers on who initiates the process. Push model A sender service inside the Drogue Cloud instance constantly tries to reach out to a target destination, trying to deliver messages. This might be a Knative eventing service, which tries to deliver messages from the Kafka topic to an HTTP endpoint. Pull mode A passive service inside the Drogue Cloud instance that waits for a consumer to connect. Once the consumer connected successfully, messages start to flow. This might be an MQTT server, which publishes messages to the consumer once it subscribed. Authentication (authn) and authorization (authz) happens in two different realms[2] of the system. On the device facing side and on the user/application facing side. And while it may be technically incorrect, in the next few paragraphs \"authentication\" implies authentication and authorization, unless noted otherwise. The device facing authentication is backed by the device registry, which is the central storage for device information and configuration. It also stores credentials of devices, like passwords or X.509 trust anchors. The user facing authentication is backed by an Open ID connect, single sign-on system. By default we use Keycloak, however it should be possible to use any other Open ID connect compatible solution. Services internally also use the same SSO solution as external users. 1. Technically it is a Knative eventing service, which could be implemented by different technologies. The default implementation for Drogue Cloud though is Kafka. 2.

However, what we actually mean is: devices, gateways, and services. Device A device, directly connected to Drogue Cloud. This may be an embedded device, or a more powerfull compute node with a full blown operating system. It may also be a containerized application, running inside an Edge node, connecting to Drogue Cloud. Gateway A device, which acts as a proxy for other devices, that may not directly connect to Drogue Cloud. This may be some kind of Linux machine, which allows non-IP enabled devices, like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices, to connect to Drogue Cloud, by forwarding messages between the two protocols. Services In some cases a gateway is not a single device, but a bigger, maybe cloud based, service as well. Still it acts as a proxy for devices to communicate with Drogue Cloud. An example might be \"The Things Network\" (TTN), or \"Sigfox\". Both services have their own technical infrastructure to which devices connect. These services act as a proxy to their devices. From a Drogue Cloud perspective such services are \"gateways\" as well. It may be, that between Drogue Cloud and the actual device, additional \"gateways\", like a LoRaWAN gateway, are in place. A LoRa device might connect to its local gateway, which connects to the TTN network, which then connects to Drogue Cloud. However, for Drogue Cloud only the device which directly connects (TTN service) and the originating device (the actual device) is important. Intermediate gateways may be in play, but are not relevant.","title":"Devices, Gateways & Services","component":"drogue-cloud","version":"0.4","name":"devices","url":"/drogue-cloud/0.4/architecture/devices.html","titles":[]},"41":{"id":41,"text":"The main purpose of Drogue IoT cloud is to connect applications with devices.

However, we do require a few steps before and after the deployment. Installing dependencies on the cluster and setting URLs afterwards. For this we have a magic installer script, that does everything for you. It is suited for an easy start on a local test cluster. The installer package is part of the GitHub release record: https://github.com/drogue-iot/drogue-cloud/releases/tag/v0.3.0 There is one package for each type of Kubernetes cluster: install-minikube – For using with Minikube install-kind – For using with Kind install-openshift – For using with OpenShift Download the package, matching the cluster you plan to use. Unzip the package and change into the folder extracted from the archive. The installer will create a new instance of Drogue Cloud on the cluster you are currently logged in to. By default, this includes: Installing Knative Installing Strimzi Creating a Kafka cluster Installing the Keycloak operator Create a custom CA for the endpoints If you want to install those dependencies manually, for example using OLM, you can opt-out of the installation (see below). Run the installer script ./script/drogue.sh, adding the options appropriate for your setup. You can use the environment variable CLUSTER to define which cluster type you have. Default cluster type By default, the cluster type will be minikube for the script in the repository. For the installers, this default value will be changed to the installer type you downloaded. You can still override the default, using: env CLUSTER=kind ./script/drogue.sh Most options are controlled by using environment variables. You can set them by prefixing the call to the installation script, using env and the variable assignment: env CLUSTER=kind INSTALL_DEPS=false ./script/drogue.sh If you want to install the dependencies (like Strimzi, KNative) yourself, you can opt out of installing the dependencies. Variable Name Default value Description INSTALL_DEPS true Control the installation of all dependencies. INSTALL_KNATIVE ${INSTALL_DEPS} Control the installation of the Knative stack. INSTALL_KEYCLOAK_OPERATOR ${INSTALL_DEPS} Control the installation of the Keycloak operator. You can change the namespace where of the Drogue Cloud components get installed using the variable DROGUE_NS. The default is drogue-iot. Currently, you can only change the namespace of the Drogue Cloud installation. The namespaces of Knative, Strimzi, are currently not configurable. By default, the installer script will create a custom certificate authority. However, if you already have a key and certificate, you can instruct the installer to use these. There are two options to achieve this. The installer will check if the secrets http-endpoint-tls and mqtt-endpoint-tls exist. If they don’t it will create them either using provided or generated key and certificate material. If you manually create these TLS secrets, using those names, before running the installer, it will not override these existing secrets. You can set the environment variable TLS_KEY and TLS_CRT, pointing them to PEM encoded key and certificate. Should something go wrong, it should be possible to just re-run the installer script. That should simply set the desired state again, and Kubernetes should reconcile accordingly. In most of the cases, this works just fine. After the installer script has run, it will show some information on how you can connect to the system and give some example commands to try out.","title":"Installer script","component":"drogue-cloud","version":"0.4","name":"installer","url":"/drogue-cloud/0.4/deployment/installer.html","titles":[{"text":"Download the installer package","hash":"_download_the_installer_package","id":1},{"text":"Unpacking","hash":"_unpacking","id":2},{"text":"What to expect","hash":"_what_to_expect","id":3},{"text":"Running the installer","hash":"_running_the_installer","id":4},{"text":"Additional installer options","hash":"_additional_installer_options","id":5},{"text":"Skip the dependency installation","hash":"_skip_the_dependency_installation","id":6},{"text":"Change the target namespace","hash":"_change_the_target_namespace","id":7},{"text":"Provide custom TLS certificates","hash":"_provide_custom_tls_certificates","id":8},{"text":"Manually create the TLS secrets","hash":"_manually_create_the_tls_secrets","id":9},{"text":"Using local key and certificate files","hash":"_using_local_key_and_certificate_files","id":10},{"text":"Re-running the installer","hash":"_re_running_the_installer","id":11},{"text":"Status information","hash":"_status_information","id":12}]},"47":{"id":47,"text":"Deploying Drogue Cloud, you will need a few tools on your local machine.

Endpoints, more explicitly protocol endpoints, is where device connect to, in order to communicate with the system. On the device facing side these endpoints implement a device specific protocol, and on the cloud facing side, they communicate using Knative and Cloud Events. A protocol might be a binary protocol, custom to the device. Or also some other higher level API, based on existing communication protocols like MQTT, HTTP, or CoAP. This is sometimes also called: Protocol Adapter South-bound Device-bound Integrations provide ways to integrate your application with the event stream of the system. While integration may support different protocols (like HTTP, MQTT) they should focus on content being encoded as Cloud Events. In general there are two different ways of receiving data through integrations: push or pull. In the case of \"push\", the cloud side of Drogue will try to push events to an endpoint that you define. In the case of \"pull\", you connect to an integration endpoint and subscribe to events you are interested in. Once subscribed, events will be pushed through that communication channel.

The Grafana dashboard has an example dashboard visualizing these readings. \"Temperate readings\" are identified by a payload being JSON and containing a temp field on the root level object. This is considered an example, and allows to quickly try out Drogue Cloud services. Typically, Grafana and InfluxDB would be \"user application\", which would run outside the Drogue Cloud namespace or cluster.

While the system has a single sign-on system for the user facing services, devices, especially embedded devices, are more limited and using OAuth tokens might not be a good fit. In general, devices have different usage patterns when it comes to authentication and authorization. Open ID connect and OAuth are designed with a strong focus on HTTP. Which is great, when it comes to authenticate users using browsers and REST clients, but becomes a burden when embedded systems and protocols like MQTT and CoAP come into play. Drogue Cloud tries to make it as easy as possible for devices to connect to the cloud side, and so we believe that technologies like pre-shared keys, X.509 client certificates, or simple \"username/password\" credentials are a better fit for devices. Still, for user/application facing application we use Open ID connect, as you can read in Single sign-on. A PostgreSQL compatible database is used to persist the information. The device registry component consists of several services, which provides internal and external APIs to access the data stored in this database. (Device) Management API Allows external access to the application and device information. This is a REST API, which allows using management tools and applications to create, edit, delete, and view data stored inside the device registry. User Auth Service Allows internal applications to check if a user has access to a requested resource. This is for example used by the web frontend, to ensure a user may use the \"message spy\" to access messages of this application. Or by the management API to check if a user may perform the requested operation on a resource. This service works with read-only access to the database, and can work with a ready-only slave replica. Device Auth Service Allows internal application to authenticate and authorize a device. For example, this service is being used by the protocol endpoints, to grant devices access for publishing data to the system. Validating credentials like passwords or X.509 client certificates. Once authenticated, it also reports backs additional device configuration for the endpoints, like core mapping information for the LoRaWAN \"function ports\". This service works with read-only access to the database, and can work with a ready-only slave replica. In addition to the management API, which allows getting/reading information out of the registry, the registry will also send \"change events\", when resources get modified. This is again built on top of Knative eventing, and allows services to act on the modification of applications and devices. Using this concept, it is possible to implement \"controllers\" (or \"operators\"), which reconcile the desired state of a resource. One example of this, is the \"The Things Network\" (TTN) controller, which detects a TTN specific section in the device configuration, and then tries to create an appropriate device in a linked TTN instance. Currently, this functionality is considered \"internal\", and such change events cannot be consumed from outside the system. Drogue Cloud has a single sign-on (SSO) service, which by default is implemented by Keycloak. As mentioned before, the SSO service is used to authenticate users and applications, not devices. It is also used internally, to manage access between the internal services. The authorization however, the check if a user has access to a device or application, is handled by the \"user auth service\", which is backed by the device registry. The SSO service is also used in order to integrate other services, like the Eclipse Ditto based digital twin service, or the example Grafana Dashboard.","title":"Control plane","component":"drogue-cloud","version":"0.5","name":"control","url":"/drogue-cloud/0.5/architecture/control.html","titles":[{"text":"Device registry","hash":"_device_registry","id":1},{"text":"Provided services","hash":"_provided_services","id":2},{"text":"Change events for integration","hash":"_change_events_for_integration","id":3},{"text":"Single sign-on","hash":"_single_sign_on","id":4}]},"52":{"id":52,"text":"A core feature of Drogue Cloud is the abstraction of protocols. Typical IoT protocols are MQTT, CoAP, OPC UA, but also HTTP is being used by some devices. Ideally, your cloud side application only needs to think about implementing one protocol, in order to interact with your devices. However, different IoT protocols provide benefits on the device side. As the devices are more constrained than the cloud side, Drogue Cloud tries to levarage the benefits of IoT protocols, while providing a normalization layer on the cloud side, that makes it easy for your applications to consume the data. But also on the cloud side, different ways to consume data exists. May that be a direct connection to a Kafka topic, again MQTT, or a simple Web socket connection. Drogue Cloud tries to be integrate as good as possible, and not force you into a specific API. Drogue Cloud is based on Knative, and internally uses the Cloud Events specification to forward messages. Cloud events on the other side have different mappings to transport channels, such as MQTT, Kafka, HTTP, etc.. And while Cloud Events can also be used on the external interfaces of Drogue Cloud, it isn’t a requirement, and you can use your custom protocols as you need. Devices communicate with the Protocol endpoints, which implement the protocol specific mapping between the actual protocol and the internal Cloud Events based message format. The protocol endpoints also authentication and authorize devices and its configured gateways. Validate credentials, or X.509 client certificates and ensure that the devices are enabled in the system. Once the device is granted access to publish (or receive) data, the protocol endpoint will hook up the device to the internal message flow. It subscribes to commands targeted towards the device, and forwards messages from the device to an internal Knative eventing endpoint which takes care of processing and delivering the messgaes. The actual payload of the messages is not processed, and just passed on the Knative eventing destination. In some cases the payload of an incoming request is not equal to the payload of the actual message. For example, a request from \"The Things Network\" (TTN) conists of a payload, which contains meta data (like the device ID), and then the actual payload of the original message from the device. In cases like this it depends on the protocol adapter what it considers payload and what is metadata. In the case of TTN, you can configure if you want to have the full request payload, or just the original device payload. When a protocol endpoint drops off an incoming message to the Knative eventing service, this service is backed by a Kafka topic[1]. The responsibility of Kafka is to deliver messages to the target consumer. Peristing messages if needed, and handling shared consumer groups if requested. This allows Drogue Cloud to buffer messages when the consumer is unavailable or of there is a peak of messages that the consumer currently cannot handle. Also, this allows to drive a shared consumer model, where in a group of consumers only one receives a messages. This concept is used to share the load for messages to multiple instances of a consumer. As mentioned before, Drogue Cloud relies on a Knative eventing destination which provides these guarantees, and uses Kafka to implement this. However, it is possible to replace the Kafka implementation with a different implementation. Applications, like devices, are provided by the user and live outside of the Drogue Cloud instance. They still may run on the same cluster. By \"consuming\" messages, we mean that messages, sent by a device, are forwarded to the target application. It also implies a channel back to the device, for sending commands. However, as device-to-cloud messages are much more frequent, we simply focus on \"consuming\" messages. In general there are \"push\" or \"pull\" modes. Messages are always sent to the consumer in an event oriented manner, \"push\" and \"pull\" only refers on who initiates the process. Push model A sender service inside the Drogue Cloud instance constantly tries to reach out to a target destination, trying to deliver messages. This might be a Knative eventing service, which tries to deliver messages from the Kafka topic to an HTTP endpoint. Pull mode A passive service inside the Drogue Cloud instance that waits for a consumer to connect. Once the consumer connected successfully, messages start to flow. This might be an MQTT server, which publishes messages to the consumer once it subscribed. Authentication (authn) and authorization (authz) happens in two different realms[2] of the system. On the device facing side and on the user/application facing side. And while it may be technically incorrect, in the next few paragraphs \"authentication\" implies authentication and authorization, unless noted otherwise. The device facing authentication is backed by the device registry, which is the central storage for device information and configuration. It also stores credentials of devices, like passwords or X.509 trust anchors. The user facing authentication is backed by an Open ID connect, single sign-on system. By default we use Keycloak, however it should be possible to use any other Open ID connect compatible solution. Services internally also use the same SSO solution as external users. 1. Technically it is a Knative eventing service, which could be implemented by different technologies. The default implementation for Drogue Cloud though is Kafka. 2.

However, what we actually mean is: devices, gateways, and services. Device A device, directly connected to Drogue Cloud. This may be an embedded device, or a more powerfull compute node with a full blown operating system. It may also be a containerized application, running inside an Edge node, connecting to Drogue Cloud. Gateway A device, which acts as a proxy for other devices, that may not directly connect to Drogue Cloud. This may be some kind of Linux machine, which allows non-IP enabled devices, like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices, to connect to Drogue Cloud, by forwarding messages between the two protocols. Services In some cases a gateway is not a single device, but a bigger, maybe cloud based, service as well. Still it acts as a proxy for devices to communicate with Drogue Cloud. An example might be \"The Things Network\" (TTN), or \"Sigfox\". Both services have their own technical infrastructure to which devices connect. These services act as a proxy to their devices. From a Drogue Cloud perspective such services are \"gateways\" as well. It may be, that between Drogue Cloud and the actual device, additional \"gateways\", like a LoRaWAN gateway, are in place. A LoRa device might connect to its local gateway, which connects to the TTN network, which then connects to Drogue Cloud. However, for Drogue Cloud only the device which directly connects (TTN service) and the originating device (the actual device) is important. Intermediate gateways may be in play, but are not relevant.","title":"Devices, Gateways & Services","component":"drogue-cloud","version":"0.5","name":"devices","url":"/drogue-cloud/0.5/architecture/devices.html","titles":[]},"54":{"id":54,"text":"The main purpose of Drogue IoT cloud is to connect applications with devices.

You can set them by prefixing the call to the installation script, using env and the variable assignment: env CLUSTER=kind INSTALL_DEPS=false ./script/drogue.sh If you want to install the dependencies (like Strimzi, KNative) yourself, you can opt out of installing the dependencies. Variable Name Default value Description INSTALL_DEPS true Control the installation of all dependencies. INSTALL_KNATIVE ${INSTALL_DEPS} Control the installation of the Knative stack. INSTALL_KEYCLOAK_OPERATOR ${INSTALL_DEPS} Control the installation of the Keycloak operator. You can change the namespace where of the Drogue Cloud components get installed using the variable DROGUE_NS. The default is drogue-iot. Currently, you can only change the namespace of the Drogue Cloud installation. The namespaces of Knative, Strimzi, are currently not configurable. By default, the installer script will create a custom certificate authority. However, if you already have a key and certificate, you can instruct the installer to use these. There are two options to achieve this. The installer will check if the secrets http-endpoint-tls and mqtt-endpoint-tls exist. If they don’t it will create them either using provided or generated key and certificate material. If you manually create these TLS secrets, using those names, before running the installer, it will not override these existing secrets. You can set the environment variable TLS_KEY and TLS_CRT, pointing them to PEM encoded key and certificate. Should something go wrong, it should be possible to just re-run the installer script. That should simply set the desired state again, and Kubernetes should reconcile accordingly. In most of the cases, this works just fine. After the installer script has run, it will show some information on how you can connect to the system and give some example commands to try out.","title":"Installer script","component":"drogue-cloud","version":"0.5","name":"installer","url":"/drogue-cloud/0.5/deployment/installer.html","titles":[{"text":"Download the installer package","hash":"_download_the_installer_package","id":1},{"text":"Unpacking","hash":"_unpacking","id":2},{"text":"What to expect","hash":"_what_to_expect","id":3},{"text":"Running the installer","hash":"_running_the_installer","id":4},{"text":"Additional installer options","hash":"_additional_installer_options","id":5},{"text":"Skip the dependency installation","hash":"_skip_the_dependency_installation","id":6},{"text":"Change the target namespace","hash":"_change_the_target_namespace","id":7},{"text":"Provide custom TLS certificates","hash":"_provide_custom_tls_certificates","id":8},{"text":"Manually create the TLS secrets","hash":"_manually_create_the_tls_secrets","id":9},{"text":"Using local key and certificate files","hash":"_using_local_key_and_certificate_files","id":10},{"text":"Re-running the installer","hash":"_re_running_the_installer","id":11},{"text":"Status information","hash":"_status_information","id":12}]},"60":{"id":60,"text":"Deploying Drogue Cloud, you will need a few tools on your local machine.

Endpoints, more explicitly protocol endpoints, is where device connect to, in order to communicate with the system. On the device facing side these endpoints implement a device specific protocol, and on the cloud facing side, they communicate using Knative and Cloud Events. A protocol might be a binary protocol, custom to the device. Or also some other higher level API, based on existing communication protocols like MQTT, HTTP, or CoAP. This is sometimes also called: Protocol Adapter South-bound Device-bound Integrations provide ways to integrate your application with the event stream of the system. While integration may support different protocols (like HTTP, MQTT) they should focus on content being encoded as Cloud Events. In general there are two different ways of receiving data through integrations: push or pull. In the case of \"push\", the cloud side of Drogue will try to push events to an endpoint that you define.

The Grafana dashboard has an example dashboard visualizing these readings. \"Temperate readings\" are identified by a payload being JSON and containing a temp field on the root level object. This is considered an example, and allows to quickly try out Drogue Cloud services.

While the system has a single sign-on system for the user facing services, devices, especially embedded devices, are more limited and using OAuth tokens might not be a good fit. In general, devices have different usage patterns when it comes to authentication and authorization. Open ID connect and OAuth are designed with a strong focus on HTTP. Which is great, when it comes to authenticate users using browsers and REST clients, but becomes a burden when embedded systems and protocols like MQTT and CoAP come into play. Drogue Cloud tries to make it as easy as possible for devices to connect to the cloud side, and so we believe that technologies like pre-shared keys, X.509 client certificates, or simple \"username/password\" credentials are a better fit for devices. Still, for user/application facing application we use Open ID connect, as you can read in Single sign-on. A PostgreSQL compatible database is used to persist the information. The device registry component consists of several services, which provides internal and external APIs to access the data stored in this database. (Device) Management API Allows external access to the application and device information. This is a REST API, which allows using management tools and applications to create, edit, delete, and view data stored inside the device registry. User Auth Service Allows internal applications to check if a user has access to a requested resource. This is for example used by the web frontend, to ensure a user may use the \"message spy\" to access messages of this application. Or by the management API to check if a user may perform the requested operation on a resource. This service works with read-only access to the database, and can work with a ready-only slave replica. Device Auth Service Allows internal application to authenticate and authorize a device. For example, this service is being used by the protocol endpoints, to grant devices access for publishing data to the system. Validating credentials like passwords or X.509 client certificates. Once authenticated, it also reports backs additional device configuration for the endpoints, like core mapping information for the LoRaWAN \"function ports\". This service works with read-only access to the database, and can work with a ready-only slave replica. In addition to the management API, which allows getting/reading information out of the registry, the registry will also send \"change events\", when resources get modified. This is again built on top of Knative eventing, and allows services to act on the modification of applications and devices. Using this concept, it is possible to implement \"controllers\" (or \"operators\"), which reconcile the desired state of a resource. One example of this, is the \"The Things Network\" (TTN) controller, which detects a TTN specific section in the device configuration, and then tries to create an appropriate device in a linked TTN instance. Currently, this functionality is considered \"internal\", and such change events cannot be consumed from outside the system. Drogue Cloud has a single sign-on (SSO) service, which by default is implemented by Keycloak. As mentioned before, the SSO service is used to authenticate users and applications, not devices. It is also used internally, to manage access between the internal services. The authorization however, the check if a user has access to a device or application, is handled by the \"user auth service\", which is backed by the device registry. The SSO service is also used in order to integrate other services, like the Eclipse Ditto based digital twin service, or the example Grafana Dashboard.","title":"Control plane","component":"drogue-cloud","version":"0.6","name":"control","url":"/drogue-cloud/0.6/architecture/control.html","titles":[{"text":"Device registry","hash":"_device_registry","id":1},{"text":"Provided services","hash":"_provided_services","id":2},{"text":"Change events for integration","hash":"_change_events_for_integration","id":3},{"text":"Single sign-on","hash":"_single_sign_on","id":4}]},"68":{"id":68,"text":"A core feature of Drogue Cloud is the abstraction of protocols. Typical IoT protocols are MQTT, CoAP, OPC UA, but also HTTP is being used by some devices. Ideally, your cloud side application only needs to think about implementing one protocol, in order to interact with your devices. However, different IoT protocols provide benefits on the device side. As the devices are more constrained than the cloud side, Drogue Cloud tries to levarage the benefits of IoT protocols, while providing a normalization layer on the cloud side, that makes it easy for your applications to consume the data. But also on the cloud side, different ways to consume data exists. May that be a direct connection to a Kafka topic, again MQTT, or a simple Web socket connection. Drogue Cloud tries to be integrate as good as possible, and not force you into a specific API. Drogue Cloud is based on Knative, and internally uses the Cloud Events specification to forward messages. Cloud events on the other side have different mappings to transport channels, such as MQTT, Kafka, HTTP, etc.. And while Cloud Events can also be used on the external interfaces of Drogue Cloud, it isn’t a requirement, and you can use your custom protocols as you need. Devices communicate with the Protocol endpoints, which implement the protocol specific mapping between the actual protocol and the internal Cloud Events based message format. The protocol endpoints also authentication and authorize devices and its configured gateways. Validate credentials, or X.509 client certificates and ensure that the devices are enabled in the system. Once the device is granted access to publish (or receive) data, the protocol endpoint will hook up the device to the internal message flow. It subscribes to commands targeted towards the device, and forwards messages from the device to an internal Knative eventing endpoint which takes care of processing and delivering the messgaes. The actual payload of the messages is not processed, and just passed on the Knative eventing destination. In some cases the payload of an incoming request is not equal to the payload of the actual message. For example, a request from \"The Things Network\" (TTN) conists of a payload, which contains meta data (like the device ID), and then the actual payload of the original message from the device. In cases like this it depends on the protocol adapter what it considers payload and what is metadata. In the case of TTN, you can configure if you want to have the full request payload, or just the original device payload. When a protocol endpoint drops off an incoming message to the Knative eventing service, this service is backed by a Kafka topic[1]. The responsibility of Kafka is to deliver messages to the target consumer. Peristing messages if needed, and handling shared consumer groups if requested. This allows Drogue Cloud to buffer messages when the consumer is unavailable or of there is a peak of messages that the consumer currently cannot handle. Also, this allows to drive a shared consumer model, where in a group of consumers only one receives a messages. This concept is used to share the load for messages to multiple instances of a consumer. As mentioned before, Drogue Cloud relies on a Knative eventing destination which provides these guarantees, and uses Kafka to implement this. However, it is possible to replace the Kafka implementation with a different implementation. Applications, like devices, are provided by the user and live outside of the Drogue Cloud instance. They still may run on the same cluster. By \"consuming\" messages, we mean that messages, sent by a device, are forwarded to the target application. It also implies a channel back to the device, for sending commands. However, as device-to-cloud messages are much more frequent, we simply focus on \"consuming\" messages. In general there are \"push\" or \"pull\" modes. Messages are always sent to the consumer in an event oriented manner, \"push\" and \"pull\" only refers on who initiates the process. Push model A sender service inside the Drogue Cloud instance constantly tries to reach out to a target destination, trying to deliver messages. This might be a Knative eventing service, which tries to deliver messages from the Kafka topic to an HTTP endpoint. Pull mode A passive service inside the Drogue Cloud instance that waits for a consumer to connect. Once the consumer connected successfully, messages start to flow. This might be an MQTT server, which publishes messages to the consumer once it subscribed. Authentication (authn) and authorization (authz) happens in two different realms[2] of the system. On the device facing side and on the user/application facing side. And while it may be technically incorrect, in the next few paragraphs \"authentication\" implies authentication and authorization, unless noted otherwise. The device facing authentication is backed by the device registry, which is the central storage for device information and configuration. It also stores credentials of devices, like passwords or X.509 trust anchors. The user facing authentication is backed by an Open ID connect, single sign-on system. By default we use Keycloak, however it should be possible to use any other Open ID connect compatible solution. Services internally also use the same SSO solution as external users. 1. Technically it is a Knative eventing service, which could be implemented by different technologies. The default implementation for Drogue Cloud though is Kafka. 2.

However, what we actually mean is: devices, gateways, and services. Device A device, directly connected to Drogue Cloud. This may be an embedded device, or a more powerfull compute node with a full blown operating system. It may also be a containerized application, running inside an Edge node, connecting to Drogue Cloud. Gateway A device, which acts as a proxy for other devices, that may not directly connect to Drogue Cloud. This may be some kind of Linux machine, which allows non-IP enabled devices, like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices, to connect to Drogue Cloud, by forwarding messages between the two protocols. Services In some cases a gateway is not a single device, but a bigger, maybe cloud based, service as well. Still it acts as a proxy for devices to communicate with Drogue Cloud. An example might be \"The Things Network\" (TTN), or \"Sigfox\". Both services have their own technical infrastructure to which devices connect. These services act as a proxy to their devices. From a Drogue Cloud perspective such services are \"gateways\" as well. It may be, that between Drogue Cloud and the actual device, additional \"gateways\", like a LoRaWAN gateway, are in place. A LoRa device might connect to its local gateway, which connects to the TTN network, which then connects to Drogue Cloud. However, for Drogue Cloud only the device which directly connects (TTN service) and the originating device (the actual device) is important. Intermediate gateways may be in play, but are not relevant.","title":"Devices, Gateways & Services","component":"drogue-cloud","version":"0.6","name":"devices","url":"/drogue-cloud/0.6/architecture/devices.html","titles":[]},"70":{"id":70,"text":"The main purpose of Drogue IoT cloud is to connect applications with devices.

Unzip the package and change into the folder extracted from the archive. The installer will create a new instance of Drogue Cloud on the cluster you are currently logged in to. By default, this includes: Installing Knative Installing Strimzi Creating a Kafka cluster Installing the Keycloak operator Create a custom CA for the endpoints If you want to install those dependencies manually, for example using OLM, you can opt-out of the installation (see below). Run the installer script ./script/drgadm deploy, adding the options appropriate for your setup. You can use the environment variable CLUSTER to define which cluster type you have. Default cluster type By default, the cluster type will be minikube for the script in the repository. For the installers, this default value will be changed to the installer type you downloaded. You can still override the default, using: env CLUSTER=kind ./script/drgadm deploy The deploy command of drgadm supports the following argument -k or INSTALL_DEPS Don’t install any dependency by default. -s Set additional Helm values. May be repeated multiple times. -m Minimize: Reduces the default resource requests to allow deploying on more constrained environments. -d or DOMAIN Manually provide the application DNS domain. -c or CLUSTER Specify the cluster type (any of minikube, kind, openshift, kubernetes). -p Adds an additional Helm value file, named deploy/helm/profiles/.yaml. -n or DROGUE_NS Changes the target Drogue IoT namespace. The installer has a few additional options which are controlled by using environment variables. You can set them by prefixing the call to the installation script, using env and the variable assignment: env CLUSTER=kind INSTALL_DEPS=false ./script/drgadm deploy If you want to install the dependencies (like Strimzi, KNative) yourself, you can opt out of installing the dependencies. Variable Name Default value Description INSTALL_DEPS true Control the installation of all dependencies. INSTALL_KNATIVE ${INSTALL_DEPS} Control the installation of the Knative stack. INSTALL_KEYCLOAK_OPERATOR ${INSTALL_DEPS} Control the installation of the Keycloak operator. You can change the namespace where of the Drogue Cloud components get installed using the variable DROGUE_NS. The default is drogue-iot. Currently, you can only change the namespace of the Drogue Cloud installation. The namespaces of Knative, Strimzi, are currently not configurable. By default, the installer script will create a custom certificate authority. However, if you already have a key and certificate, you can instruct the installer to use these. There are two options to achieve this. The installer will check if the secrets http-endpoint-tls and mqtt-endpoint-tls exist. If they don’t it will create them either using provided or generated key and certificate material. If you manually create these TLS secrets, using those names, before running the installer, it will not override these existing secrets. You can set the environment variable TLS_KEY and TLS_CRT, pointing them to PEM encoded key and certificate. Should something go wrong, it should be possible to just re-run the installer script. That should simply set the desired state again, and Kubernetes should reconcile accordingly. In most of the cases, this works just fine. After the installer script has run, it will show some information on how you can connect to the system and give some example commands to try out.","title":"Installer script","component":"drogue-cloud","version":"0.6","name":"installer","url":"/drogue-cloud/0.6/deployment/installer.html","titles":[{"text":"Download the installer package","hash":"_download_the_installer_package","id":1},{"text":"Unpacking","hash":"_unpacking","id":2},{"text":"What to expect","hash":"_what_to_expect","id":3},{"text":"Running the installer","hash":"_running_the_installer","id":4},{"text":"Additional installer options","hash":"_additional_installer_options","id":5},{"text":"Skip the dependency installation","hash":"_skip_the_dependency_installation","id":6},{"text":"Change the target namespace","hash":"_change_the_target_namespace","id":7},{"text":"Provide custom TLS certificates","hash":"_provide_custom_tls_certificates","id":8},{"text":"Manually create the TLS secrets","hash":"_manually_create_the_tls_secrets","id":9},{"text":"Using local key and certificate files","hash":"_using_local_key_and_certificate_files","id":10},{"text":"Re-running the installer","hash":"_re_running_the_installer","id":11},{"text":"Status information","hash":"_status_information","id":12}]},"76":{"id":76,"text":"Deploying Drogue Cloud, you will need a few tools on your local machine.

Endpoints, more explicitly protocol endpoints, is where device connect to, in order to communicate with the system. On the device facing side these endpoints implement a device specific protocol, and on the cloud facing side, they communicate using Knative and Cloud Events.

While integration may support different protocols (like HTTP, MQTT) they should focus on content being encoded as Cloud Events. In general there are two different ways of receiving data through integrations: push or pull. In the case of \"push\", the cloud side of Drogue will try to push events to an endpoint that you define.

While the system has a single sign-on system for the user facing services, devices, especially embedded devices, are more limited and using OAuth tokens might not be a good fit. In general, devices have different usage patterns when it comes to authentication and authorization. Open ID connect and OAuth are designed with a strong focus on HTTP. Which is great, when it comes to authenticate users using browsers and REST clients, but becomes a burden when embedded systems and protocols like MQTT and CoAP come into play. Drogue Cloud tries to make it as easy as possible for devices to connect to the cloud side, and so we believe that technologies like pre-shared keys, X.509 client certificates, or simple \"username/password\" credentials are a better fit for devices. Still, for user/application facing application we use Open ID connect, as you can read in Single sign-on. A PostgreSQL compatible database is used to persist the information. The device registry component consists of several services, which provides internal and external APIs to access the data stored in this database. (Device) Management API Allows external access to the application and device information. This is a REST API, which allows using management tools and applications to create, edit, delete, and view data stored inside the device registry. User Auth Service Allows internal applications to check if a user has access to a requested resource. This is for example used by the web frontend, to ensure a user may use the \"message spy\" to access messages of this application. Or by the management API to check if a user may perform the requested operation on a resource. This service works with read-only access to the database, and can work with a ready-only slave replica. Device Auth Service Allows internal application to authenticate and authorize a device. For example, this service is being used by the protocol endpoints, to grant devices access for publishing data to the system. Validating credentials like passwords or X.509 client certificates. Once authenticated, it also reports backs additional device configuration for the endpoints, like core mapping information for the LoRaWAN \"function ports\". This service works with read-only access to the database, and can work with a ready-only slave replica. In addition to the management API, which allows getting/reading information out of the registry, the registry will also send \"change events\", when resources get modified. This is again built on top of Knative eventing, and allows services to act on the modification of applications and devices. Using this concept, it is possible to implement \"controllers\" (or \"operators\"), which reconcile the desired state of a resource. One example of this, is the \"The Things Network\" (TTN) controller, which detects a TTN specific section in the device configuration, and then tries to create an appropriate device in a linked TTN instance. Currently, this functionality is considered \"internal\", and such change events cannot be consumed from outside the system. Drogue Cloud has a single sign-on (SSO) service, which by default is implemented by Keycloak. As mentioned before, the SSO service is used to authenticate users and applications, not devices. It is also used internally, to manage access between the internal services. The authorization however, the check if a user has access to a device or application, is handled by the \"user auth service\", which is backed by the device registry. The SSO service is also used in order to integrate other services, like the Eclipse Ditto based digital twin service, or the example Grafana Dashboard.","title":"Control plane","component":"drogue-cloud","version":"0.7","name":"control","url":"/drogue-cloud/0.7/introduction/control.html","titles":[{"text":"Device registry","hash":"_device_registry","id":1},{"text":"Provided services","hash":"_provided_services","id":2},{"text":"Change events for integration","hash":"_change_events_for_integration","id":3},{"text":"Single sign-on","hash":"_single_sign_on","id":4}]},"89":{"id":89,"text":"A core feature of Drogue Cloud is the abstraction of protocols. Typical IoT protocols are MQTT, CoAP, OPC UA, but also HTTP is being used by some devices. Ideally, your cloud side application only needs to think about implementing one protocol, in order to interact with your devices. However, different IoT protocols provide benefits on the device side. As the devices are more constrained than the cloud side, Drogue Cloud tries to levarage the benefits of IoT protocols, while providing a normalization layer on the cloud side, that makes it easy for your applications to consume the data. But also on the cloud side, different ways to consume data exists. May that be a direct connection to a Kafka topic, again MQTT, or a simple Web socket connection. Drogue Cloud tries to be integrate as good as possible, and not force you into a specific API. Drogue Cloud is based on Knative, and internally uses the Cloud Events specification to forward messages. Cloud events on the other side have different mappings to transport channels, such as MQTT, Kafka, HTTP, etc.. And while Cloud Events can also be used on the external interfaces of Drogue Cloud, it isn’t a requirement, and you can use your custom protocols as you need. Devices communicate with the Protocol endpoints, which implement the protocol specific mapping between the actual protocol and the internal Cloud Events based message format. The protocol endpoints also authentication and authorize devices and its configured gateways. Validate credentials, or X.509 client certificates and ensure that the devices are enabled in the system. Once the device is granted access to publish (or receive) data, the protocol endpoint will hook up the device to the internal message flow. It subscribes to commands targeted towards the device, and forwards messages from the device to an internal Knative eventing endpoint which takes care of processing and delivering the messgaes. The actual payload of the messages is not processed, and just passed on the Knative eventing destination. In some cases the payload of an incoming request is not equal to the payload of the actual message. For example, a request from \"The Things Network\" (TTN) conists of a payload, which contains meta data (like the device ID), and then the actual payload of the original message from the device. In cases like this it depends on the protocol adapter what it considers payload and what is metadata. In the case of TTN, you can configure if you want to have the full request payload, or just the original device payload. When a protocol endpoint drops off an incoming message to the Knative eventing service, this service is backed by a Kafka topic[1]. The responsibility of Kafka is to deliver messages to the target consumer. Peristing messages if needed, and handling shared consumer groups if requested. This allows Drogue Cloud to buffer messages when the consumer is unavailable or of there is a peak of messages that the consumer currently cannot handle. Also, this allows to drive a shared consumer model, where in a group of consumers only one receives a messages. This concept is used to share the load for messages to multiple instances of a consumer. As mentioned before, Drogue Cloud relies on a Knative eventing destination which provides these guarantees, and uses Kafka to implement this. However, it is possible to replace the Kafka implementation with a different implementation. Applications, like devices, are provided by the user and live outside of the Drogue Cloud instance. They still may run on the same cluster. By \"consuming\" messages, we mean that messages, sent by a device, are forwarded to the target application. It also implies a channel back to the device, for sending commands. However, as device-to-cloud messages are much more frequent, we simply focus on \"consuming\" messages. In general there are \"push\" or \"pull\" modes. Messages are always sent to the consumer in an event oriented manner, \"push\" and \"pull\" only refers on who initiates the process. Push model A sender service inside the Drogue Cloud instance constantly tries to reach out to a target destination, trying to deliver messages. This might be a Knative eventing service, which tries to deliver messages from the Kafka topic to an HTTP endpoint. Pull mode A passive service inside the Drogue Cloud instance that waits for a consumer to connect. Once the consumer connected successfully, messages start to flow. This might be an MQTT server, which publishes messages to the consumer once it subscribed. Authentication (authn) and authorization (authz) happens in two different realms[2] of the system. On the device facing side and on the user/application facing side. And while it may be technically incorrect, in the next few paragraphs \"authentication\" implies authentication and authorization, unless noted otherwise. The device facing authentication is backed by the device registry, which is the central storage for device information and configuration. It also stores credentials of devices, like passwords or X.509 trust anchors. The user facing authentication is backed by an Open ID connect, single sign-on system. By default we use Keycloak, however it should be possible to use any other Open ID connect compatible solution. Services internally also use the same SSO solution as external users. 1. Technically it is a Knative eventing service, which could be implemented by different technologies. The default implementation for Drogue Cloud though is Kafka. 2. The term \"realm\" doesn’t refer to an HTTP or Keycloak \"realm\" here","title":"Data plane","component":"drogue-cloud","version":"0.7","name":"data","url":"/drogue-cloud/0.7/introduction/data.html","titles":[{"text":"Protocol normalization","hash":"_protocol_normalization","id":1},{"text":"Message persistence","hash":"_message_persistence","id":2},{"text":"Consuming messages","hash":"_consuming_messages","id":3},{"text":"Authentication & authorization","hash":"_authentication_authorization","id":4}]},"90":{"id":90,"text":"Most of this documentation talks about \"devices\". However, what we actually mean is: devices, gateways, and services. Device A device, directly connected to Drogue Cloud. This may be an embedded device, or a more powerfull compute node with a full blown operating system. It may also be a containerized application, running inside an Edge node, connecting to Drogue Cloud. Gateway A device, which acts as a proxy for other devices, that may not directly connect to Drogue Cloud. This may be some kind of Linux machine, which allows non-IP enabled devices, like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices, to connect to Drogue Cloud, by forwarding messages between the two protocols. Services In some cases a gateway is not a single device, but a bigger, maybe cloud based, service as well. Still it acts as a proxy for devices to communicate with Drogue Cloud. An example might be \"The Things Network\" (TTN), or \"Sigfox\". Both services have their own technical infrastructure to which devices connect. These services act as a proxy to their devices. From a Drogue Cloud perspective such services are \"gateways\" as well. It may be, that between Drogue Cloud and the actual device, additional \"gateways\", like a LoRaWAN gateway, are in place. A LoRa device might connect to its local gateway, which connects to the TTN network, which then connects to Drogue Cloud. However, for Drogue Cloud only the device which directly connects (TTN service) and the originating device (the actual device) is important. Intermediate gateways may be in play, but are not relevant.","title":"Devices, Gateways & Services","component":"drogue-cloud","version":"0.7","name":"devices","url":"/drogue-cloud/0.7/introduction/devices.html","titles":[]},"91":{"id":91,"text":"The main purpose of Drogue IoT cloud is to connect applications with devices.

Of course this diagram over-simplifies the problem. And still, connecting to a device to a simple, single backend application is a trivial task. So what does Drogue Cloud do? And why is it a more complex than a simple MQTT broker? The following sections will dive into the architecture of Drogue Cloud, and will explain what the benefit if this architecture is. The following sections will use My device and My application. These are the devices and applications that a user of Drogue Cloud would bring and try to connect. These applications are not provided by Drogue Cloud. Drogue Device provides tools to create the firmware of such devices if they are embedded micro-controllers. However, Drogue Cloud also allows to integrate larger devices, like Linux systems, gateways and it can integrate with other, existing IoT services. Drogue Cloud is intended to create an as a service experience. This means that the typical user of Drogue Cloud would not set up and install Drogue Cloud, but use an existing, hosted instance. Still, it is possible to set up your own instance, and use this for only one application and user. However, the decision to make this a shared multi-user system, make some aspects more complicated.

Currently, the endpoint does not support DTLS. It is not recommended to use this in production or to transfer any sensitive data over public networks. Before communicating with the endpoint, the respective device and application need to be registered with drogue cloud. The coap requests made to the endpoint need to be of the following format: coap:///v1/{channel}/{subject(optional)} The UriPath option should be set with v1, channel name and subject name(optional). Optional parameters can also be passed, but they need to be URL encoded. The rules for encoding the device and application name can be viewed over here. The following parameters can be passed as queries: application: The specific application ID that the device is sending telemetry to device: The device ID data_schema: Data schema of the payload as: Allows the device to alias another ID ct: The amount of time the device will wait for incoming commands For a device to receive commands, it must send a request with a specified timeout. The command will piggyback on the response—the responsibility to track when the device issues a request and promptly issue the command lies on the application. Authentication information is sent using the CoAP option number 4209. It is carried out using HTTP-like authentication headers. For example: Basic ZGV2aWNlMUBhcHAxOmhleS1yb2RuZXk Here, we use the HTTP Basic authentication scheme, along with the base64 encoded device authentication information. The format of the device authentication information is @:.

A device would receive a response with the 2.04(Changed) status code if the publish action were successful. If the request passed the ct(command timeout) parameter and a command is sent to the device within this interval, the device will receive the 2.05(Content) response code. The contents of the command can then be read from the CoAP option 4210. If a request fails, the device can receive responses with appropriate status codes.

However, we do require a few steps before and after the deployment. Installing dependencies on the cluster and setting URLs afterwards. For this we have a magic installer script, that does everything for you. It is suited for an easy start on a local test cluster. The installer package is part of the GitHub release record: https://github.com/drogue-iot/drogue-cloud/releases/latest There is one package for each type of Kubernetes cluster: install-minikube – For using with Minikube install-kind – For using with Kind install-openshift – For using with OpenShift Download the package, matching the cluster you plan to use. Unzip the package and change into the folder extracted from the archive. The installer will create a new instance of Drogue Cloud on the cluster you are currently logged in to. By default, this includes: Installing Knative Installing Strimzi Creating a Kafka cluster Installing the Keycloak operator Create a custom CA for the endpoints If you want to install those dependencies manually, for example using OLM, you can opt-out of the installation (see below). Run the installer script ./script/drgadm deploy, adding the options appropriate for your setup. You can use the environment variable CLUSTER to define which cluster type you have. Default cluster type By default, the cluster type will be minikube for the script in the repository. For the installers, this default value will be changed to the installer type you downloaded. You can still override the default, using: env CLUSTER=kind ./script/drgadm deploy The deploy command of drgadm supports the following argument -k or INSTALL_DEPS Don’t install any dependency by default. -s Set additional Helm values. May be repeated multiple times. -m Minimize: Reduces the default resource requests to allow deploying on more constrained environments. -d or DOMAIN Manually provide the application DNS domain. -c or CLUSTER Specify the cluster type (any of minikube, kind, openshift, kubernetes). -p Adds an additional Helm value file, named deploy/helm/profiles/.yaml. -n or DROGUE_NS Changes the target Drogue IoT namespace. The installer has a few additional options which are controlled by using environment variables. You can set them by prefixing the call to the installation script, using env and the variable assignment: env CLUSTER=kind INSTALL_DEPS=false ./script/drgadm deploy If you want to install the dependencies (like Strimzi, KNative) yourself, you can opt out of installing the dependencies. Variable Name Default value Description INSTALL_DEPS true Control the installation of all dependencies. INSTALL_KNATIVE ${INSTALL_DEPS} Control the installation of the Knative stack. INSTALL_KEYCLOAK_OPERATOR ${INSTALL_DEPS} Control the installation of the Keycloak operator. You can change the namespace where of the Drogue Cloud components get installed using the variable DROGUE_NS. The default is drogue-iot. Currently, you can only change the namespace of the Drogue Cloud installation. The namespaces of Knative, Strimzi, are currently not configurable. By default, the installer script will create a custom certificate authority. However, if you already have a key and certificate, you can instruct the installer to use these. There are two options to achieve this. The installer will check if the secrets http-endpoint-tls and mqtt-endpoint-tls exist. If they don’t it will create them either using provided or generated key and certificate material. If you manually create these TLS secrets, using those names, before running the installer, it will not override these existing secrets. You can set the environment variable TLS_KEY and TLS_CRT, pointing them to PEM encoded key and certificate. Should something go wrong, it should be possible to just re-run the installer script. That should simply set the desired state again, and Kubernetes should reconcile accordingly. In most of the cases, this works just fine. After the installer script has run, it will show some information on how you can connect to the system and give some example commands to try out.","title":"Installer script","component":"drogue-cloud","version":"0.8","name":"installer","url":"/drogue-cloud/0.8/deployment/installer.html","titles":[{"text":"Download the installer package","hash":"_download_the_installer_package","id":1},{"text":"Unpacking","hash":"_unpacking","id":2},{"text":"What to expect","hash":"_what_to_expect","id":3},{"text":"Running the installer","hash":"_running_the_installer","id":4},{"text":"Additional installer options","hash":"_additional_installer_options","id":5},{"text":"Skip the dependency installation","hash":"_skip_the_dependency_installation","id":6},{"text":"Change the target namespace","hash":"_change_the_target_namespace","id":7},{"text":"Provide custom TLS certificates","hash":"_provide_custom_tls_certificates","id":8},{"text":"Manually create the TLS secrets","hash":"_manually_create_the_tls_secrets","id":9},{"text":"Using local key and certificate files","hash":"_using_local_key_and_certificate_files","id":10},{"text":"Re-running the installer","hash":"_re_running_the_installer","id":11},{"text":"Status information","hash":"_status_information","id":12}]},"112":{"id":112,"text":"Deploying Drogue Cloud, you will need a few tools on your local machine.

The Grafana dashboard has an example dashboard visualizing these readings. \"Temperate readings\" are identified by a payload being JSON and containing a temp field on the root level object. This is considered an example, and allows to quickly try out Drogue Cloud services.

While the system has a single sign-on system for the user facing services, devices, especially embedded devices, are more limited and using OAuth tokens might not be a good fit. In general, devices have different usage patterns when it comes to authentication and authorization. Open ID connect and OAuth are designed with a strong focus on HTTP. Which is great, when it comes to authenticate users using browsers and REST clients, but becomes a burden when embedded systems and protocols like MQTT and CoAP come into play. Drogue Cloud tries to make it as easy as possible for devices to connect to the cloud side, and so we believe that technologies like pre-shared keys, X.509 client certificates, or simple \"username/password\" credentials are a better fit for devices. Still, for user/application facing application we use Open ID connect, as you can read in Single sign-on. A PostgreSQL compatible database is used to persist the information. The device registry component consists of several services, which provides internal and external APIs to access the data stored in this database. (Device) Management API Allows external access to the application and device information. This is a REST API, which allows using management tools and applications to create, edit, delete, and view data stored inside the device registry. User Auth Service Allows internal applications to check if a user has access to a requested resource. This is for example used by the web frontend, to ensure a user may use the \"message spy\" to access messages of this application. Or by the management API to check if a user may perform the requested operation on a resource. This service works with read-only access to the database, and can work with a ready-only slave replica. Device Auth Service Allows internal application to authenticate and authorize a device. For example, this service is being used by the protocol endpoints, to grant devices access for publishing data to the system. Validating credentials like passwords or X.509 client certificates. Once authenticated, it also reports backs additional device configuration for the endpoints, like core mapping information for the LoRaWAN \"function ports\". This service works with read-only access to the database, and can work with a ready-only slave replica. In addition to the management API, which allows getting/reading information out of the registry, the registry will also send \"change events\", when resources get modified. This is again built on top of Knative eventing, and allows services to act on the modification of applications and devices. Using this concept, it is possible to implement \"controllers\" (or \"operators\"), which reconcile the desired state of a resource. One example of this, is the \"The Things Network\" (TTN) controller, which detects a TTN specific section in the device configuration, and then tries to create an appropriate device in a linked TTN instance. Currently, this functionality is considered \"internal\", and such change events cannot be consumed from outside the system. Drogue Cloud has a single sign-on (SSO) service, which by default is implemented by Keycloak. As mentioned before, the SSO service is used to authenticate users and applications, not devices. It is also used internally, to manage access between the internal services. The authorization however, the check if a user has access to a device or application, is handled by the \"user auth service\", which is backed by the device registry. The SSO service is also used in order to integrate other services, like the Eclipse Ditto based digital twin service, or the example Grafana Dashboard.","title":"Control plane","component":"drogue-cloud","version":"0.8","name":"control","url":"/drogue-cloud/0.8/introduction/control.html","titles":[{"text":"Device registry","hash":"_device_registry","id":1},{"text":"Provided services","hash":"_provided_services","id":2},{"text":"Change events for integration","hash":"_change_events_for_integration","id":3},{"text":"Single sign-on","hash":"_single_sign_on","id":4}]},"115":{"id":115,"text":"A core feature of Drogue Cloud is the abstraction of protocols. Typical IoT protocols are MQTT, CoAP, OPC UA, but also HTTP is being used by some devices. Ideally, your cloud side application only needs to think about implementing one protocol, in order to interact with your devices. However, different IoT protocols provide benefits on the device side. As the devices are more constrained than the cloud side, Drogue Cloud tries to levarage the benefits of IoT protocols, while providing a normalization layer on the cloud side, that makes it easy for your applications to consume the data. But also on the cloud side, different ways to consume data exists. May that be a direct connection to a Kafka topic, again MQTT, or a simple Web socket connection. Drogue Cloud tries to be integrate as good as possible, and not force you into a specific API. Drogue Cloud is based on Knative, and internally uses the Cloud Events specification to forward messages. Cloud events on the other side have different mappings to transport channels, such as MQTT, Kafka, HTTP, etc.. And while Cloud Events can also be used on the external interfaces of Drogue Cloud, it isn’t a requirement, and you can use your custom protocols as you need. Devices communicate with the Protocol endpoints, which implement the protocol specific mapping between the actual protocol and the internal Cloud Events based message format. The protocol endpoints also authentication and authorize devices and its configured gateways. Validate credentials, or X.509 client certificates and ensure that the devices are enabled in the system. Once the device is granted access to publish (or receive) data, the protocol endpoint will hook up the device to the internal message flow. It subscribes to commands targeted towards the device, and forwards messages from the device to an internal Knative eventing endpoint which takes care of processing and delivering the messgaes. The actual payload of the messages is not processed, and just passed on the Knative eventing destination. In some cases the payload of an incoming request is not equal to the payload of the actual message. For example, a request from \"The Things Network\" (TTN) conists of a payload, which contains meta data (like the device ID), and then the actual payload of the original message from the device. In cases like this it depends on the protocol adapter what it considers payload and what is metadata. In the case of TTN, you can configure if you want to have the full request payload, or just the original device payload. When a protocol endpoint drops off an incoming message to the Knative eventing service, this service is backed by a Kafka topic[1]. The responsibility of Kafka is to deliver messages to the target consumer. Peristing messages if needed, and handling shared consumer groups if requested. This allows Drogue Cloud to buffer messages when the consumer is unavailable or of there is a peak of messages that the consumer currently cannot handle. Also, this allows to drive a shared consumer model, where in a group of consumers only one receives a messages. This concept is used to share the load for messages to multiple instances of a consumer. As mentioned before, Drogue Cloud relies on a Knative eventing destination which provides these guarantees, and uses Kafka to implement this. However, it is possible to replace the Kafka implementation with a different implementation. Applications, like devices, are provided by the user and live outside of the Drogue Cloud instance. They still may run on the same cluster. By \"consuming\" messages, we mean that messages, sent by a device, are forwarded to the target application. It also implies a channel back to the device, for sending commands. However, as device-to-cloud messages are much more frequent, we simply focus on \"consuming\" messages. In general there are \"push\" or \"pull\" modes. Messages are always sent to the consumer in an event oriented manner, \"push\" and \"pull\" only refers on who initiates the process. Push model A sender service inside the Drogue Cloud instance constantly tries to reach out to a target destination, trying to deliver messages. This might be a Knative eventing service, which tries to deliver messages from the Kafka topic to an HTTP endpoint. Pull mode A passive service inside the Drogue Cloud instance that waits for a consumer to connect. Once the consumer connected successfully, messages start to flow. This might be an MQTT server, which publishes messages to the consumer once it subscribed. Authentication (authn) and authorization (authz) happens in two different realms[2] of the system. On the device facing side and on the user/application facing side. And while it may be technically incorrect, in the next few paragraphs \"authentication\" implies authentication and authorization, unless noted otherwise. The device facing authentication is backed by the device registry, which is the central storage for device information and configuration. It also stores credentials of devices, like passwords or X.509 trust anchors. The user facing authentication is backed by an Open ID connect, single sign-on system. By default we use Keycloak, however it should be possible to use any other Open ID connect compatible solution. Services internally also use the same SSO solution as external users. 1. Technically it is a Knative eventing service, which could be implemented by different technologies. The default implementation for Drogue Cloud though is Kafka. 2.

However, what we actually mean is: devices, gateways, and services. Device A device, directly connected to Drogue Cloud. This may be an embedded device, or a more powerfull compute node with a full blown operating system. It may also be a containerized application, running inside an Edge node, connecting to Drogue Cloud. Gateway A device, which acts as a proxy for other devices, that may not directly connect to Drogue Cloud. This may be some kind of Linux machine, which allows non-IP enabled devices, like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices, to connect to Drogue Cloud, by forwarding messages between the two protocols. Services In some cases a gateway is not a single device, but a bigger, maybe cloud based, service as well. Still it acts as a proxy for devices to communicate with Drogue Cloud. An example might be \"The Things Network\" (TTN), or \"Sigfox\". Both services have their own technical infrastructure to which devices connect. These services act as a proxy to their devices. From a Drogue Cloud perspective such services are \"gateways\" as well. It may be, that between Drogue Cloud and the actual device, additional \"gateways\", like a LoRaWAN gateway, are in place. A LoRa device might connect to its local gateway, which connects to the TTN network, which then connects to Drogue Cloud. However, for Drogue Cloud only the device which directly connects (TTN service) and the originating device (the actual device) is important. Intermediate gateways may be in play, but are not relevant.","title":"Devices, Gateways & Services","component":"drogue-cloud","version":"0.8","name":"devices","url":"/drogue-cloud/0.8/introduction/devices.html","titles":[]},"117":{"id":117,"text":"The main purpose of Drogue IoT cloud is to connect applications with devices.

Events are encoded as CloudEvents. The MQTT integration service allows to connect using standard MQTT mechanisms. Depending on the deployment, either using TLS or non-TLS connections. The service supports both MQTT v3.1.1 and MQTT 5. It is possible to use anonymous authentication. This may severely limit access to data, but in some special cases, this may be a viable use case. You can use the OAuth2 access token of your user as either username or password (not both at the same time!). When using MQTT v3.1.1, you must pass the token as the username, as this version of MQTT doesn’t allow to send a password only. Token expiration OAuth2 access tokens are only valid for a short amount of time. You need to provide a non-expired access token in order to log in. For this, you most likely need to refresh the token before every connection attempt. An alternative is to use API keys instead. When providing a username and a password, the username must be the name of your user, and the password must be an API key created for that user. In order to subscribe to events, subscribe using the following filter: app/. So to subscribe to example-app, you need to subscribe to app/example-app. The default data format follows the MQTT binding for CloudEvents using the \"structured content mode\", which includes all information, metadata and actual payload, as part of the MQTT payload. When using MQTT 5, you can request the service to send events in the \"binary content mode\", which encodes the metadata as part of the MQTT user properties. In this case, the MQTT payload is equal to the actual CloudEvents payload. As this encoding make use of \"user properties\", it is not available when using MQTT v3.1.1. By default, each MQTT subscriber uses its own Kafka consumer group, and thus receives each message. However, you can use MQTT shared subscriptions to define a shared consumer group, which maps to using the same Kafka consumer group on the backend. In this case, only one of the consumers will receive a message. To subscribe using shared subscriptions, use the following subscription filter: $share//app/. So when subscribing to the application my-app with the shared consumer identifier my-group, you would use: $share/my-group/my-app. You can send back a command to a device by publishing to the following topic: command///. For example, sending the command setTemperature with payload {\"value\": 1.23 } to the device my-device of the application my-app, you would need to publish the payload {\"value\": 1.23 } to the topic command/my-app/my-device/setTemperature.","title":"MQTT integration","component":"drogue-cloud","version":"0.8","name":"integration-mqtt","url":"/drogue-cloud/0.8/user-guide/integration-mqtt.html","titles":[{"text":"Connecting","hash":"_connecting","id":1},{"text":"Anonymous","hash":"_anonymous","id":2},{"text":"OAuth2 Token","hash":"_oauth2_token","id":3},{"text":"API Key","hash":"_api_key","id":4},{"text":"Subscribe to events","hash":"_subscribe_to_events","id":5},{"text":"Data format","hash":"_data_format","id":6},{"text":"Binary content mode","hash":"_binary_content_mode","id":7},{"text":"Shared subscriptions","hash":"_shared_subscriptions","id":8},{"text":"Publish commands","hash":"_publish_commands","id":9}]},"129":{"id":129,"text":"The WebSocket integration allows consuming device events using a simple WebSockets based protocol.Events are encoded as CloudEvents.","title":"WebSocket integration","component":"drogue-cloud","version":"0.8","name":"integration-ws","url":"/drogue-cloud/0.8/user-guide/integration-ws.html","titles":[]},"130":{"id":130,"text":"The following sections will guide you through the basic management capabilities of Drogue Cloud. All management operations are available through the API. However, for an easier getting started experience, the following examples will use the command line tool drg for performing the operations. All following examples require that you are already logged in to a Drogue Cloud cluster using the command line tool drg. An application is the container for devices. A user can have multiple applications, but each device belongs to a single application. Create a new application using the following command: drg create app my-app This will create a new application named my-app. If the application name is already used, you will receive an error, as application names are unique. Applications are defined by a JSON structure. It is possible to edit this structure in YAML format (for easier editing) using the following command: drg edit app my-app This will open an editor, and allow you to make modifications to the YAML source. When you close the editor, the change will be sent to the server for updating. An existing application can be deleted using the following command: drg delete app my-app Deleting an application me be delayed, as first all devices which require to be cleaned up will be processes. Once this is finished, the application might require cleanup too. Only once all resources are properly cleaned up, the application will be actually deleted. As devices belong to an application, you need to create an application first. The following commands will explicitly select the application by providing the --app argument. You can however use drg config set-default-app, to set a default application and omit the --app argument. A new device is being created using the following command: drg create device --app my-app my-device-1 This will create my-device-1 as part of my-app. In most cases a device will require additional information, like access credentials or gateway assignments. You can provide initial configuration using the --spec argument: drg create device --app my-app my-device-1 --spec '{\"credentials\": {\"credentials\":[{ \"pass\": \"foobar\" }]}}' The --spec argument accepts a JSON string of the full \"spec\" section of the device. You can edit the device configuration in YAML the same as the application: drg edit device --app my-app my-device-1 This will open an editor, and allow you to make modifications to the YAML source. When you close the editor, the change will be sent to the server for updating. An existing device can be deleted using the following command: drg delete device --app my-app my-device-1 If a device requires any cleanup, the device will be first marked as deleted, the cleanup will be processed, and then the device will be deleted. It is possible to set a password as access credentials. This way, when connecting, the username will be the device name. You have created a device Configure the device, adding a password credentials entry: metadata: name: device # … spec: # … credentials: credentials: - pass: my-password (1) 1 One credential entry of type \"password\". You can also use hashed passwords. For this, you need to specify the hash algorithm: metadata: name: device # … spec: # … credentials: credentials: - pass: bcrypt: \"$2a$12$WsLmgORBv3WHZ3CjCiMzXOeo2hL5UEeq8PEd11q9BfbM/RWqb7c3G\" (1) 1 One credential entry of type \"password\" as \"bcrypt\" hash. See Supported hashes for a list of supported password hashes. It is also possible to set a username and password as credentials. In this case, the device ID must be transmitted through an alternate way, in order to look up the device. The provided username/password combination will then be checked against the configured username/password combination. The way the device name is transmitted to the endpoint depends on the capabilities of the protocol endpoint. For example, using HTTP, the device name can be provided as an additional query parameter. You have created a device Configure the device, adding a password credentials entry: metadata: name: device (1) # … spec: # … credentials: credentials: - user: username: device-user (2) password: bar (3) 1 The device name 2 The username 3 The plain text password You can also use hashed passwords, instead of plain text: metadata: name: device (1) # … spec: # … credentials: credentials: - user: username: device-user (2) password: bcrypt: \"$2a$12$WsLmgORBv3WHZ3CjCiMzXOeo2hL5UEeq8PEd11q9BfbM/RWqb7c3G\" (3) 1 The device name 2 The username 3 The bcrypt hashed password See Supported hashes for a list of supported password hashes. If you want to use the username only for authenticating your device, without the need to provide an additional device identifier, you can use \"unique usernames\". These usernames are unique per application. You have created a device Configure the device, adding a password credentials entry: metadata: name: device # … spec: # … credentials: credentials: - user: username: device-user password: bar unique: true (1) 1 Setting the value to true makes the entry a unique username entry. As described in Setting username/password credentials, you can use hashed passwords too. Every device can act as a gateway for another device. However, it must be granted the permission to act on behalf of that other device. The way this is done, is by adding this information to the device connects through a gateway. You have created two devices. One that should act as gateway (named gateway in the following steps). One that should act as the actual device (named sensor in the following steps). The gateway device has access credentials configured, so that the gateway can connect to the cloud. In the configuration of the actual device, select the devices that can act as a gateway: metadata: name: sensor # … spec: # … gatewaySelector: matchNames: - gateway It is possible to use one or more devices as gateway. It is possible to store passwords either plain text or hashed.

Each device is owned by exactly one application and has at least one ID to identify it. Device IDs are unique in the scope of an application. Endpoints, more explicitly protocol endpoints, is where device connect to, in order to communicate with the system. On the device facing side these endpoints implement a device specific protocol, and on the cloud facing side, they communicate using Knative and Cloud Events. A protocol might be a binary protocol, custom to the device. Or also some other higher level API, based on existing communication protocols like MQTT, HTTP, or CoAP. This is sometimes also called: Protocol Adapter South-bound Device-bound Integrations provide ways to integrate your application with the event stream of the system. While integration may support different protocols (like HTTP, MQTT) they should focus on content being encoded as Cloud Events. In general there are two different ways of receiving data through integrations: push or pull. In the case of \"push\", the cloud side of Drogue will try to push events to an endpoint that you define. In the case of \"pull\", you connect to an integration endpoint and subscribe to events you are interested in. Once subscribed, events will be pushed through that communication channel.

However, we do require a few steps before and after the deployment. Installing dependencies on the cluster and setting URLs afterwards. For this we have a magic installer script, that does everything for you. It is suited for an easy start on a local test cluster. The installer package is part of the GitHub release record: https://github.com/drogue-iot/drogue-cloud/releases/latest There is one package for each type of Kubernetes cluster: install-minikube – For using with Minikube install-kind – For using with Kind install-openshift – For using with OpenShift Download the package, matching the cluster you plan to use. Unzip the package and change into the folder extracted from the archive. The installer will create a new instance of Drogue Cloud on the cluster you are currently logged in to. By default, this includes: Installing Strimzi Creating a Kafka cluster Installing the Keycloak operator Create a custom CA for the endpoints If you want to install those dependencies manually, for example using OLM, you can opt-out of the installation (see below). Additionally, it installs Knative and an example application and can install digital twin feature as well. Deployment of these components can be configured using installer arguments as explained below. Run the installer script ./script/drgadm deploy, adding the options appropriate for your setup. You can use the -c argument to define which cluster type you have. Default cluster type By default, the cluster type will be minikube for the script in the repository. For the installers, this default value will be changed to the installer type you downloaded. You can still override the default, using: ./script/drgadm deploy -c kind The deploy command of drgadm supports the following argument -k or INSTALL_DEPS Don’t install any dependency by default. -s Set additional Helm values. May be repeated multiple times. -m Minimize: Reduces the default resource requests to allow deploying on more constrained environments. -d or DOMAIN Manually provide the application DNS domain. -c or CLUSTER Specify the cluster type (any of minikube, kind, openshift, kubernetes). -p Adds an additional Helm value file, named deploy/helm/profiles/.yaml. -t Helm installation timeout (default: 15m) -n or DROGUE_NS Changes the target Drogue IoT namespace. -T Install digital twin feature. -e Don’t install examples. -M Deploy metrics Example: Install Drogue Cloud on kind cluster without dependencies. ./script/drgadm deploy -c kind -k The -k argument will skip installing all dependencies. If you want to install of just some of the dependencies (like Strimzi or Keycloak) yourself, you can opt out of installing them by the script. The installer has a few additional options which are controlled by using environment variables. You can set them by prefixing the call to the installation script, using env and the variable assignment: env INSTALL_STRIMZI=false ./script/drgadm deploy Variable Name Default value Description INSTALL_STRIMZI ${INSTALL_DEPS} Control the installation of Strimzi. INSTALL_KEYCLOAK_OPERATOR ${INSTALL_DEPS} Control the installation of the Keycloak operator. By default the example dashboard is installed by the script. You can turn it off by using -e argument. Additionally, digital twin feature can be installed by specifying -T argument. Knative will be installed only if either examples or digital twin feature are installed. To deploy minimal installation without any examples (and Knative) use: ./script/drgadm deploy -e You can change the namespace where of the Drogue Cloud components get installed using the variable DROGUE_NS. The default is drogue-iot. Currently, you can only change the namespace of the Drogue Cloud installation. The namespaces of Knative, Strimzi, are currently not configurable. By default, the installer script will create a custom certificate authority. However, if you already have a key and certificate, you can instruct the installer to use these. There are two options to achieve this. The installer will check if the secrets http-endpoint-tls, mqtt-endpoint-tls and coap-endpoint-tls exist. If they don’t it will create them using generated key and certificate material. If you manually create these TLS secrets, using those names, before running the installer, it will not override these existing secrets. You can do that by running shell commands similar to these: kubectl -n drogue-iot create secret tls http-endpoint-tls --key $PATH_TO_CERT/tls.key --cert $PATH_TO_CERT/tls.crt --dry-run=client -o json | kubectl -n drogue-iot apply -f - kubectl -n drogue-iot create secret tls mqtt-endpoint-tls --key $PATH_TO_CERT/tls.key --cert $PATH_TO_CERT/tls.crt --dry-run=client -o json | kubectl -n drogue-iot apply -f - kubectl -n drogue-iot create secret tls coap-endpoint-tls --key $PATH_TO_CERT/tls.key --cert $PATH_TO_CERT/tls.crt --dry-run=client -o json | kubectl -n drogue-iot apply -f - Where $PATH_TO_CERT should point to the path location of your certificate. Should something go wrong, it should be possible to just re-run the installer script. That should simply set the desired state again, and Kubernetes should reconcile accordingly.

The Grafana dashboard has an example dashboard visualizing these readings. \"Temperate readings\" are identified by a payload being JSON and containing a temp field on the root level object. This is considered an example, and allows to quickly try out Drogue Cloud services.

While the system has a single sign-on system for the user facing services, devices, especially embedded devices, are more limited and using OAuth tokens might not be a good fit. In general, devices have different usage patterns when it comes to authentication and authorization. Open ID connect and OAuth are designed with a strong focus on HTTP. Which is great, when it comes to authenticate users using browsers and REST clients, but becomes a burden when embedded systems and protocols like MQTT and CoAP come into play. Drogue Cloud tries to make it as easy as possible for devices to connect to the cloud side, and so we believe that technologies like pre-shared keys, X.509 client certificates, or simple \"username/password\" credentials are a better fit for devices. Still, for user/application facing application we use Open ID connect, as you can read in Single sign-on. A PostgreSQL compatible database is used to persist the information. The device registry component consists of several services, which provides internal and external APIs to access the data stored in this database. (Device) Management API Allows external access to the application and device information. This is a REST API, which allows using management tools and applications to create, edit, delete, and view data stored inside the device registry. User Auth Service Allows internal applications to check if a user has access to a requested resource. This is for example used by the web frontend, to ensure a user may use the \"message spy\" to access messages of this application. Or by the management API to check if a user may perform the requested operation on a resource. This service works with read-only access to the database, and can work with a ready-only slave replica. Device Auth Service Allows internal application to authenticate and authorize a device. For example, this service is being used by the protocol endpoints, to grant devices access for publishing data to the system. Validating credentials like passwords or X.509 client certificates. Once authenticated, it also reports backs additional device configuration for the endpoints, like core mapping information for the LoRaWAN \"function ports\". This service works with read-only access to the database, and can work with a ready-only slave replica. In addition to the management API, which allows getting/reading information out of the registry, the registry will also send \"change events\", when resources get modified. This is again built on top of Knative eventing, and allows services to act on the modification of applications and devices. Using this concept, it is possible to implement \"controllers\" (or \"operators\"), which reconcile the desired state of a resource. One example of this, is the \"The Things Network\" (TTN) controller, which detects a TTN specific section in the device configuration, and then tries to create an appropriate device in a linked TTN instance. Currently, this functionality is considered \"internal\", and such change events cannot be consumed from outside the system. Drogue Cloud has a single sign-on (SSO) service, which by default is implemented by Keycloak. As mentioned before, the SSO service is used to authenticate users and applications, not devices. It is also used internally, to manage access between the internal services. The authorization however, the check if a user has access to a device or application, is handled by the \"user auth service\", which is backed by the device registry. The SSO service is also used in order to integrate other services, like the Eclipse Ditto based digital twin service, or the example Grafana Dashboard.","title":"Control plane","component":"drogue-cloud","version":"0.9","name":"control","url":"/drogue-cloud/0.9/introduction/control.html","titles":[{"text":"Device registry","hash":"_device_registry","id":1},{"text":"Provided services","hash":"_provided_services","id":2},{"text":"Change events for integration","hash":"_change_events_for_integration","id":3},{"text":"Single sign-on","hash":"_single_sign_on","id":4}]},"143":{"id":143,"text":"A core feature of Drogue Cloud is the abstraction of protocols. Typical IoT protocols are MQTT, CoAP, OPC UA, but also HTTP is being used by some devices. Ideally, your cloud side application only needs to think about implementing one protocol, in order to interact with your devices. However, different IoT protocols provide benefits on the device side. As the devices are more constrained than the cloud side, Drogue Cloud tries to levarage the benefits of IoT protocols, while providing a normalization layer on the cloud side, that makes it easy for your applications to consume the data. But also on the cloud side, different ways to consume data exists. May that be a direct connection to a Kafka topic, again MQTT, or a simple Web socket connection. Drogue Cloud tries to be integrate as good as possible, and not force you into a specific API. Drogue Cloud is based on Knative, and internally uses the Cloud Events specification to forward messages. Cloud events on the other side have different mappings to transport channels, such as MQTT, Kafka, HTTP, etc.. And while Cloud Events can also be used on the external interfaces of Drogue Cloud, it isn’t a requirement, and you can use your custom protocols as you need. Devices communicate with the Protocol endpoints, which implement the protocol specific mapping between the actual protocol and the internal Cloud Events based message format. The protocol endpoints also authentication and authorize devices and its configured gateways. Validate credentials, or X.509 client certificates and ensure that the devices are enabled in the system. Once the device is granted access to publish (or receive) data, the protocol endpoint will hook up the device to the internal message flow. It subscribes to commands targeted towards the device, and forwards messages from the device to an internal Knative eventing endpoint which takes care of processing and delivering the messgaes. The actual payload of the messages is not processed, and just passed on the Knative eventing destination. In some cases the payload of an incoming request is not equal to the payload of the actual message. For example, a request from \"The Things Network\" (TTN) conists of a payload, which contains meta data (like the device ID), and then the actual payload of the original message from the device. In cases like this it depends on the protocol adapter what it considers payload and what is metadata. In the case of TTN, you can configure if you want to have the full request payload, or just the original device payload. When a protocol endpoint drops off an incoming message to the Knative eventing service, this service is backed by a Kafka topic[1]. The responsibility of Kafka is to deliver messages to the target consumer. Peristing messages if needed, and handling shared consumer groups if requested. This allows Drogue Cloud to buffer messages when the consumer is unavailable or of there is a peak of messages that the consumer currently cannot handle. Also, this allows to drive a shared consumer model, where in a group of consumers only one receives a messages. This concept is used to share the load for messages to multiple instances of a consumer. As mentioned before, Drogue Cloud relies on a Knative eventing destination which provides these guarantees, and uses Kafka to implement this. However, it is possible to replace the Kafka implementation with a different implementation. Applications, like devices, are provided by the user and live outside of the Drogue Cloud instance. They still may run on the same cluster. By \"consuming\" messages, we mean that messages, sent by a device, are forwarded to the target application. It also implies a channel back to the device, for sending commands. However, as device-to-cloud messages are much more frequent, we simply focus on \"consuming\" messages. In general there are \"push\" or \"pull\" modes. Messages are always sent to the consumer in an event oriented manner, \"push\" and \"pull\" only refers on who initiates the process. Push model A sender service inside the Drogue Cloud instance constantly tries to reach out to a target destination, trying to deliver messages. This might be a Knative eventing service, which tries to deliver messages from the Kafka topic to an HTTP endpoint. Pull mode A passive service inside the Drogue Cloud instance that waits for a consumer to connect. Once the consumer connected successfully, messages start to flow. This might be an MQTT server, which publishes messages to the consumer once it subscribed. Authentication (authn) and authorization (authz) happens in two different realms[2] of the system. On the device facing side and on the user/application facing side. And while it may be technically incorrect, in the next few paragraphs \"authentication\" implies authentication and authorization, unless noted otherwise. The device facing authentication is backed by the device registry, which is the central storage for device information and configuration. It also stores credentials of devices, like passwords or X.509 trust anchors. The user facing authentication is backed by an Open ID connect, single sign-on system. By default we use Keycloak, however it should be possible to use any other Open ID connect compatible solution. Services internally also use the same SSO solution as external users. 1. Technically it is a Knative eventing service, which could be implemented by different technologies. The default implementation for Drogue Cloud though is Kafka. 2.

However, what we actually mean is: devices, gateways, and services. Device A device, directly connected to Drogue Cloud. This may be an embedded device, or a more powerfull compute node with a full blown operating system. It may also be a containerized application, running inside an Edge node, connecting to Drogue Cloud. Gateway A device, which acts as a proxy for other devices, that may not directly connect to Drogue Cloud. This may be some kind of Linux machine, which allows non-IP enabled devices, like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices, to connect to Drogue Cloud, by forwarding messages between the two protocols. Services In some cases a gateway is not a single device, but a bigger, maybe cloud based, service as well. Still it acts as a proxy for devices to communicate with Drogue Cloud. An example might be \"The Things Network\" (TTN), or \"Sigfox\". Both services have their own technical infrastructure to which devices connect. These services act as a proxy to their devices. From a Drogue Cloud perspective such services are \"gateways\" as well. It may be, that between Drogue Cloud and the actual device, additional \"gateways\", like a LoRaWAN gateway, are in place. A LoRa device might connect to its local gateway, which connects to the TTN network, which then connects to Drogue Cloud. However, for Drogue Cloud only the device which directly connects (TTN service) and the originating device (the actual device) is important. Intermediate gateways may be in play, but are not relevant.","title":"Devices, Gateways & Services","component":"drogue-cloud","version":"0.9","name":"devices","url":"/drogue-cloud/0.9/introduction/devices.html","titles":[]},"145":{"id":145,"text":"The main purpose of Drogue IoT cloud is to connect applications with devices.

Currently, the endpoint does not support DTLS. It is not recommended to use this in production or to transfer any sensitive data over public networks.

The coap requests made to the endpoint need to be of the following format: coap:///v1/{channel}/{subject(optional)} The UriPath option should be set with v1, channel name and subject name(optional). Optional parameters can also be passed, but they need to be URL encoded. The rules for encoding the device and application name can be viewed over here. The following parameters can be passed as queries: application: The specific application ID that the device is sending telemetry to device: The device ID data_schema: Data schema of the payload as: Allows the device to alias another ID ct: The amount of time the device will wait for incoming commands For a device to receive commands, it must send a request with a specified timeout. The command will piggyback on the response—the responsibility to track when the device issues a request and promptly issue the command lies on the application. Authentication information is sent using the CoAP option number 4209. It is carried out using HTTP-like authentication headers. For example: Basic ZGV2aWNlMUBhcHAxOmhleS1yb2RuZXk Here, we use the HTTP Basic authentication scheme, along with the base64 encoded device authentication information. The format of the device authentication information is @:. A sample CoAP request would look something like the following: The Request URL would be formatted like so, with the device name 'device#2' and 'device#4' percentage encoded: coap://test-url/v1/sample_channel/sample_subject?application=app1&device=device%232&data_schema=application%2Foctet-stream&as=device%232&ct=30 The value of Option 4209, representing auth information \"device1@app1:hey-rodney\": Basic ZGV2aWNlMUBhcHAxOmhleS1yb2RuZXk // present as bytes Value of the UriPath Option(obtained from request URL): v1, Rust, test // present as bytes Value of the UriQuery Option(obtained from request URL): // present as bytes application=app1&device=device%232&data_schema=application%2Foctet-stream&as=device%234&ct=30 There are two response types that a device can receive. A device would receive a response with the 2.04(Changed) status code if the publish action were successful. If the request passed the ct(command timeout) parameter and a command is sent to the device within this interval, the device will receive the 2.05(Content) response code. The contents of the command can then be read from the CoAP option 4210. If a request fails, the device can receive responses with appropriate status codes.

This is not an MQTT broker It is important to understand, that the MQTT endpoint is not a general purpose MQTT broker. It is an MQTT based API, providing access to Drogue Cloud specific functionality, using the MQTT protocol and existing MQTT tools. As MQTT is a long-lived connection, it makes sense to use it in gateway device use-cases. In this case, a device connects to the MQTT endpoint, and then also performs operations for other devices (connected via the gateway) device. Drogue Cloud supports this model. Basically every device connecting via MQTT can act as a gateway device. The devices which allow other devices to act on their behalf, must indicate this by explicitly selecting a device as their gateway. This is done using the device configuration on the device: metadata: name: sensor01 (1) application: my-app spec: credentials: {} (2) gatewaySelector: matchNames: (3) - gateway01 1 Name of the actual device. 2 Empty credentials, as this device doesn’t need to allow a direct connection. 3 Names of the devices (gateways) which are allowed to act on behalf of this device. A device can act both as direct device and as gateway a the same time. Clean session must be true You may use X.509 client certificates when establishing the TLS connection.The certificate must be signed with a trust anchor stored in the device registry on the application level. Use @ and a configured password for the device. The MQTT endpoint supports different \"dialects\" or APIs.The following subsections describe these dialects.By default, the \"Drogue V1\" dialect is use. However, you can configure the dialect of a device through the application or device configuration: see MQTT dialects. The Drogue V1 dialect is the original one, which supports all the features that Drogue Cloud offers using the MQTT endpoint. To publish data as the connected device, publish to . The channel information will be encoded in the subject header of the generated event. To publish data on behalf of another device, publish to /. If the connected device is not listed as the specified device. The message will be dropped (QoS 0) or rejected (QoS 1). The payload of the publish message will be the \"data\" of the generated event. For MQTT v5, it is possible to set the \"content type\" property, which will be used as the content type for the generated event. By default (for MQTT 3.1.1, or when the content type is not provided), the content-type will be evaluated. If the payload can be successfully parsed as JSON, the content type will be application/json. Otherwise it will be application/octet-stream. In general, the command topic structure is command/inbox//. It is however not possible to subscribe to specific commands only. Topic pattern Example topic Description command/inbox//# command/inbox//set-temp Subscribe to commands for the actual device command/inbox/my-device/# command/inbox/my-device/set-temp Subscribe to commands for the device my-device. command/inbox/# command/inbox/+/# command/inbox/my-device/set-temp command/inbox//set-temp Subscribe to commands for actual device and all devices it acts as a gateway for. The payload of the command, will be the payload of the received message. The \"plain topic\" dialect doesn’t impose any restrictions on the topic naming that devices publish to. So it is ideal for connecting existing clients via MQTT, without the need to change the publish topic structure. The downside is, that additional information (like sending on behalft of another device) which could go in the topic structure, now cannot be assigned a special meaning. The topic the client publishes to will directly be used as the channel information. If the \"device prefix\" option is enabled, then the first segment of the topic will always be used a device ID. The connected device will only act as a gateway. The same access rules apply as for all gateways and devices.

Events are encoded as CloudEvents. The MQTT integration service allows to connect using standard MQTT mechanisms. Depending on the deployment, either using TLS or non-TLS connections. The service supports both MQTT v3.1.1 and MQTT 5. It is possible to use anonymous authentication. This may severely limit access to data, but in some special cases, this may be a viable use case. You can use the OAuth2 access token of your user as either username or password (not both at the same time!). When using MQTT v3.1.1, you must pass the token as the username, as this version of MQTT doesn’t allow to send a password only. Token expiration OAuth2 access tokens are only valid for a short amount of time. You need to provide a non-expired access token in order to log in. For this, you most likely need to refresh the token before every connection attempt. An alternative is to use API keys instead. When providing a username and a password, the username must be the name of your user, and the password must be an API key created for that user. In order to subscribe to events, subscribe using the following filter: app/. So to subscribe to example-app, you need to subscribe to app/example-app. The default data format follows the MQTT binding for CloudEvents using the \"structured content mode\", which includes all information, metadata and actual payload, as part of the MQTT payload. When using MQTT 5, you can request the service to send events in the \"binary content mode\", which encodes the metadata as part of the MQTT user properties. In this case, the MQTT payload is equal to the actual CloudEvents payload. As this encoding make use of \"user properties\", it is not available when using MQTT v3.1.1. By default, each MQTT subscriber uses its own Kafka consumer group, and thus receives each message. However, you can use MQTT shared subscriptions to define a shared consumer group, which maps to using the same Kafka consumer group on the backend. In this case, only one of the consumers will receive a message. To subscribe using shared subscriptions, use the following subscription filter: $share//app/. So when subscribing to the application my-app with the shared consumer identifier my-group, you would use: $share/my-group/my-app. You can send back a command to a device by publishing to the following topic: command///. For example, sending the command setTemperature with payload {\"value\": 1.23 } to the device my-device of the application my-app, you would need to publish the payload {\"value\": 1.23 } to the topic command/my-app/my-device/setTemperature.

On top of that, oen needs to define an API. Some might disagree and say that you can just publish anything to an MQTT broker. However, implicitly, you have to agree (even when only working with your own components) to a data format and topic structure. As Drogue Cloud is payload agnostic, we don’t interfere or interpret the payload itself[1]. However, we sometimes need it interpret the metadata of events and messages, like the topic a client publishes or subscribes to. The MQTT endpoint supports multiple dialects. However, it also needs to know which dialect a device \"speaks\". Using MQTT v5, it would be easy to add some property during the connection phase, to indicate which dialect the device expects. However, as MQTT v3.1.1 still seems to be the dominant protocol version, that isn’t possible[2]. That is why Drogue Cloud keeps this configuration as part of the application or device configuration. The advantage of that is also, that it can be centrally managed. Just assume some protocol setting of your device, which is somewhere out in the field, is wrong. Being able to correct that in the cloud, might be beneficial. The configuration for MQTT dialects is located in either the application or device resource at .spec.mqtt.dialect. The configuration of a device will override the configuration of an application. If neither the application nor the device has any configuration, the drogue/v1 dialect will be used. spec: mqtt: dialect: type: plainTopic (1) devicePrefix: true (2) 1 Selects the dialect. 2 Additional options on the same level.

In that process, Drogue Cloud takes care of device connectivity, authentication & authorization, and some very basic validation steps. However, most of that processing is payload agnostic. By default, payload and metadata just forwarded as is. In some cases it would be helpful though, if metadata or payload could be altered of verified with additional logic during the reception of the event. What might come in handy in situation like this, is a rule based engine, which allows inspecting metadata and payload and decide how to process the event further. Rejecting, diverting, or altering it in the process. However, such a system can get out of hand pretty quickly, and we do not want to re-invent the wheel. A lot of systems like that already exists: Apache Camel for example, to mention just one of them. Also, allowing a user to configure a complex piece of logic for a cloud side, \"as a service\" platform can be rather tricky. Just imagine someone would validate \"what the next matching bitcoin hash\" is. It would be difficult to measure and project the costs caused by user provided validations. So Drogue Cloud tries to strike a balance. Support very simple and stateless operations, while allowing to integrate for more complex operations, hosted by the user. Just two quick examples: Drogue Cloud does offer a way to overwrite the \"content type\" attribute for an event if its channels matches a specific value. But for letting an AI/ML model categorize values of an even, we allow passing the event into an external endpoint, and consume it back as the response, before passing it along the chain. This way you can spin up your own (optionally Knative serving based) endpoint, and do complex calculations there, but do all of this as part of the Drogue Cloud device facing endpoints. The functionality is configured as part of the \"application\" resource in the .spec.publish path. The configuration consists of two main parts: rules which select when operations get triggered what operations should be performed when a rule matches Overall, even pre-processing will iterate over all rules, as defined in the order of the configuration and check if a rule matches. If it does, its operations will be executed. The outcome of an operation can one of: continue, accept, reject, drop. When the outcome is to continue, the event might have been modified, and the processing will continue with the next rule to check. When the outcome is to accept, the event might have been modified, the processing will stop, and the event will directly be delivered to the final destination. When the outcome is to reject, the event will be rejected as invalid, responding this condition to the device that sent the event, in case the device waits for a response. When the outcome is to drop, the event will be silently dropped. Towards the device, the operation is still successful. spec: publish: rules: - when: {} (1) then: [] (2) 1 One object which defines if the rule should be activated 2 An array of operations which should be executed when the rule matches You can use the isChannel matcher. For example: when: isChannel: my-channel (1) 1 The name of the channel which the event must match You can invert the outcome of a check using the not operation: when: not: isChannel: my-channel This checks if \"the channel is not `my-channel`\". A rule that always matches is always. when: always You can also turn this into \"never\" using the following: when: not: always It is also possible to use multiple checks and combined them with and or or: when: or: - isChannel: foo - isChannel: bar - isChannel: baz Which would match if the channel is either foo, bar, or baz. When an or or and check has no sub-checks, it evaluates to false. Operations are part of the then field, which is an array. All operations will be executed in order. The outcome of an operation may influence the processing of the next. If the array is empty, then simply no operations will be executed. You can silently drop the event using drop: then: drop Or accept the event directly, and stop processing following operations and rules: then: - break Rejecting the event will also stop processing, but return the provided reason back to the sender: then: - reject: This is not right It also is possible to set or remove cloud event attributes or extensions. Cloud event attributes are similar to extensions, they are just extensions that are part of the official specification and thus are treated differently. You can set or remove arbitrary extensions using: then: - setExtension: (1) name: my-ext value: my-value - removeExtension: my-other-ext (2) 1 Set extension my-ext to value my-value 2 Remove extension my-other-ext Setting an extension which already exists will overwrite the value. Removing an extension that does not exist is a no-op. As attributes are somewhat special it is only possible to set some of them. The following attributes are supported and can be set similar to the setExtension operation: datacontenttype - The content type of the event, e.g. application/json dataschema - The schema of the data, e.g. some JSON schema if the content type is JSON subject - The subject of the event, originally the \"channel\" information type - The type of the event, originally io.drogue.event.v1 This will send an event to an external endpoint and wait for the response. HTTP status code Outcome Description 200, 204 Continue The event can continue processing 202 Accept The event gets directly accepted. No further procesing is performed. 400..=499 Reject The event gets rejected.

All management operations are available through the API. However, for an easier getting started experience, the following examples will use the command line tool drg for performing the operations. All following examples require that you are already logged in to a Drogue Cloud cluster using the command line tool drg. An application is the container for devices.A user can have multiple applications, but each device belongs to a single application. Create a new application using the following command: drg create app my-app This will create a new application named my-app. If the application name is already used, you will receive an error, as application names are unique. Applications are defined by a JSON structure. It is possible to edit this structure in YAML format (for easier editing) using the following command: drg edit app my-app This will open an editor, and allow you to make modifications to the YAML source. When you close the editor, the change will be sent to the server for updating. An existing application can be deleted using the following command: drg delete app my-app Deleting an application me be delayed, as first all devices which require to be cleaned up will be processes.Once this is finished, the application might require cleanup too.Only once all resources are properly cleaned up, the application will be actually deleted. As devices belong to an application, you need to create an application first. The following commands will explicitly select the application by providing the --app argument.You can however use drg config set-default-app, to set a default application and omit the --app argument. A new device is being created using the following command: drg create device --app my-app my-device-1 This will create my-device-1 as part of my-app. In most cases a device will require additional information, like access credentials or gateway assignments. You can provide initial configuration using the --spec argument: drg create device --app my-app my-device-1 --spec '{\"credentials\": {\"credentials\":[{ \"pass\": \"foobar\" }]}}' The --spec argument accepts a JSON string of the full \"spec\" section of the device. You can edit the device configuration in YAML the same as the application: drg edit device --app my-app my-device-1 This will open an editor, and allow you to make modifications to the YAML source. When you close the editor, the change will be sent to the server for updating. An existing device can be deleted using the following command: drg delete device --app my-app my-device-1 If a device requires any cleanup, the device will be first marked as deleted, the cleanup will be processed, and then the device will be deleted. It is possible to set a password as access credentials. This way, when connecting, the username will be the device name. You have created a device Configure the device, adding a password credentials entry: metadata: name: device # … spec: # … credentials: credentials: - pass: my-password (1) 1 One credential entry of type \"password\". You can also use hashed passwords. For this, you need to specify the hash algorithm: metadata: name: device # … spec: # … credentials: credentials: - pass: bcrypt: \"$2a$12$WsLmgORBv3WHZ3CjCiMzXOeo2hL5UEeq8PEd11q9BfbM/RWqb7c3G\" (1) 1 One credential entry of type \"password\" as \"bcrypt\" hash. See Supported hashes for a list of supported password hashes. It is also possible to set a username and password as credentials. In this case, the device ID must be transmitted through an alternate way, in order to look up the device. The provided username/password combination will then be checked against the configured username/password combination. The way the device name is transmitted to the endpoint depends on the capabilities of the protocol endpoint. For example, using HTTP, the device name can be provided as an additional query parameter. You have created a device Configure the device, adding a password credentials entry: metadata: name: device (1) # … spec: # … credentials: credentials: - user: username: device-user (2) password: bar (3) 1 The device name 2 The username 3 The plain text password You can also use hashed passwords, instead of plain text: metadata: name: device (1) # … spec: # … credentials: credentials: - user: username: device-user (2) password: bcrypt: \"$2a$12$WsLmgORBv3WHZ3CjCiMzXOeo2hL5UEeq8PEd11q9BfbM/RWqb7c3G\" (3) 1 The device name 2 The username 3 The bcrypt hashed password See Supported hashes for a list of supported password hashes. If you want to use the username only for authenticating your device, without the need to provide an additional device identifier, you can use \"unique usernames\". These usernames are unique per application. You have created a device Configure the device, adding a password credentials entry: metadata: name: device # … spec: # … credentials: credentials: - user: username: device-user password: bar unique: true (1) 1 Setting the value to true makes the entry a unique username entry. As described in Setting username/password credentials, you can use hashed passwords too. Every device can act as a gateway for another device. However, it must be granted the permission to act on behalf of that other device. The way this is done, is by adding this information to the device connects through a gateway. You have created two devices. One that should act as gateway (named gateway in the following steps). One that should act as the actual device (named sensor in the following steps). The gateway device has access credentials configured, so that the gateway can connect to the cloud. In the configuration of the actual device, select the devices that can act as a gateway: metadata: name: sensor # … spec: # … gatewaySelector: matchNames: - gateway It is possible to use one or more devices as gateway.

Let’s go through a simple application for the BBC:microbit to understand it better. The application is a simple game: As a cursor traverses the LED matrix, use the button to toggle the 'set' state of each individual LED. Once all LEDs are lit, you win! The full example can be found here. The first thing you’ll notice is a few declarations stating that the application requires some nightly features: #![no_std] #![no_main] #![macro_use] #![feature(generic_associated_types)] #![feature(type_alias_impl_trait)] Then, what follows are some declarations on how to deal with panics and faults. During development, a good practice is to rely on defmt-rtt and panic-probe to print diagnostics to the terminal: use defmt_rtt as _; use panic_probe as _; Lets define the basic game first. We’ll model the game as an actor named Game, and it will drive the entire game logic and interact with the LED matrix and the 'A' button on the micro:bit board. Luckily, Drogue Device already have actors for buttons and a LED matrix driver, so we only need to create the Game actor. Lets start with the types: /// to light a red. You win when the whole board is lit. struct Game { matrix: LedMatrix, } #[derive(Clone)] pub enum GameMessage { Toggle, } impl TryFrom for GameMessage { type Error = (); fn try_from(event: ButtonEvent) -> Result { match event { ButtonEvent::Released => Ok(GameMessage::Toggle), _ => Err(()), } } } impl Game { pub fn new(matrix: LedMatrix) -> Self { Self { matrix } } } The Game type holds on to the led matrix. In addition, we define the GameMessage message that our actor will expect to be notified of whenever the button is pressed. The Address type is a handle that you can use to send messages to an Actor. Our Game actor will be reachable using an Address instance, which you get when mounting an actor. The predefined Button actor can work with any handle that implements the TryFrom trait, so we’ll add an implemented for our GameMessage type. We can now have our Game type implement the Actor trait: #[actor] impl Actor for Game { type Message = GameMessage; async fn on_mount(&mut self, _: Address, mut inbox: M) where M: Inbox + 'm, { The Message of an Actor defines the messages that our actor expects to handle. Why do you have to define the actor attribute? Rust does not yet support async methods in traits, and needs some assistance in knowing what to do. This is only temporary until Rust supports basic async traits, so for now we’ll have to live with it. We can now define the main actor logic in the on_mount implementation. The on_mount entry point is called only once, and should contain the Actor main loop. The actor is handed an address to itself. This can be useful if you need to register the Actor with other actors or types. The Address type can be cloned, so it’s easy to pass around. The Inbox parameter is a handle that the actor can use to wait for incoming messages. Having the boilerplate out of the way, we can now focus on our application. The game logic can be described as follows: Game logic Define a set of coordinates in a 5x5 matrix Initialize cursor at (0, 0) Initialize coordinates as not being visited While not all coordinates visited Lit the LED at the cursor coordinate Wait for a GameMessage to arrive within a timeout If a GameMessage::Toggle arrived, toggle the visited status at the cursor coordinate Unlit the LED at the cursor coordinate, if not visited Update cursor The game logic is implemented here: defmt::info!(\"Starting game! Press the 'A' button to lit the LED at the cursor.\"); let speed = Duration::from_millis(200); let mut coordinates: [[bool; 5]; 5] = [[false; 5]; 5]; let mut cursor = 0; let (mut x, mut y) = (0, 0); let mut done = false; let mut render = Ticker::every(Duration::from_millis(5)); while !done { self.matrix.on(x, y); // Race timeout and button press let timeout = Timer::after(speed); let event = inbox.next(); pin_mut!(timeout); pin_mut!(event); let mut logic = select(timeout, event); loop { let tick = render.next(); pin_mut!(tick); match select(tick, &mut logic).await { Either::Left((_, _)) => { self.matrix.render(); } Either::Right((f, _)) => match f { Either::Left(_) => { break; } Either::Right(_) => { // Set/unset coordinates[y][x] = !coordinates[y][x]; break; } }, } } // Unlit only if we're not set if !coordinates[y][x] { self.matrix.off(x, y) } // Check if game is done done = true; for x in 0..5 { for y in 0..5 { if !coordinates[y][x] { done = false; break; } } } x = cursor % 5; y = (cursor / 5) % 5; cursor += 1; self.matrix.render(); } The LedMatrix has an on and off method to toggle the LED at a given coordinate. In order to render the current LedMatrix state, we need to call a render function at the desired refresh interval. The \"outer\" loop does just that until one of the 'game logic' futures are completing. The inbox.next() is an async funtion that completes when an event have been received (i.e. button has been pressed). The Timer type can be used to asynchronously wait for an event. The futures select function can be used to \"race\" two async functions for completion. Therefore, the outer select races the rending loop and the inbox.next() and timer, whereas they are raced against eachother. If there is an event or timeout, we update the game state. With the game logic defined, we can now wire our three actors together in the application main: #[embassy::main] async fn main(spawner: embassy::executor::Spawner, p: Peripherals) { // Using a board support package to simplify setup let board = Microbit::new(p); // An actor for the game logic let game = spawn_actor!(spawner, GAME, Game, Game::new(board.display)); // Actor for button 'A' spawn_actor!(spawner, BUTTON_A, Button, Button::new(board.btn_a, game)); } The main entry point is defined using the #[embassy::main] macro. The entry point is also required to take a Spawner and a Peripherals argument. The Spawner is the way the main application spawns tasks and actors. The Peripherals type holds all peripherals that the application may use. For some boards, Drogue Device provide a Board Support Package (BSP) that helps locating peripherals for a given board. You can also access all peripherals using the Peripherals type. The board simply helps setting them up and giving them a name that maps to your particular board. In our case, we can use the Microbit board. Finally, we spawn an instance for each of the actors in our system: LED_MATRIX, GAME, and BUTTON_A. An Address handle of the actor is returned when spawned, and can be used as a parameter to other actors, or directly in the main function. We’ve gone through a basic application written for the BBC micro:bit. We’ve created our own Actor instance to drive the game logic, and wired it together with two other actors already defined by Drogue Device, which was simple due to the composability of actors.","title":"A basic application","component":"drogue-device","version":"dev","name":"basic_application","url":"/drogue-device/dev/basic_application.html","titles":[{"text":"Main","hash":"_main","id":1},{"text":"Rust Nightly","hash":"_rust_nightly","id":2},{"text":"Dealing with errors","hash":"_dealing_with_errors","id":3},{"text":"Defining actors","hash":"_defining_actors","id":4},{"text":"Game logic","hash":"_game_logic","id":5},{"text":"Application main","hash":"_application_main","id":6},{"text":"Summary","hash":"_summary","id":7}]},"165":{"id":165,"text":"Board Support Packages make it easier to use a particular board with Embassy, and typically uses pin and peripheral names that match what is defined on the board itself or in the board documentation.

An actor system is a framework that allows for isolating state within narrow contexts, making it easier to reason about system. Within a actor system, the primary component is an Actor, which represents the boundary of state usage. Each actor has exclusive access to its own state and only communicates with other actors through message-passing. Each actor is single-threaded, able to process a single message at a time, allowing for lock-free processing of each event. As embedded processors are globally single-threaded, supporting multiple actors requires the usage of async and .await within the Rust ecosystem. Each actor can therefore process each message either synchronously if its logic is non-blocking or using an async block if complex processing is required. Each event is fully processed, in the order in which it is received, before the next event is considered. While processing an event, an actor may send a message to another actor, which itself is an asynchronous action, allowing the system to continue to make progress with actors that are able to. All messages are sent using async channels attached to each actor. The channel depth is configurable based on const generics. Upon starting, the actor is given a handle to an Inbox from which it can await messages to arrive. Each actor within the system has its own unique Address which is used to communicate with the actor (through it’s FIFO). There is an async request(msg) method on each address to send a message asynchronously to the actor, which may only be used from another async context, as the sender must .await the response. There is also a sync notify(msg) method on each address to send a message without awaiting a response. Specifically, the Address for a given actor may implement user provided traits to provide fluent APIs for communicating with the underlying actor. For instance, the Socket type wraps an Address for actors that implement the TcpSocket trait. Each actor is wrapped in an ActorContext object which is stored as a static (global). When the application starts, each context is `mount(…​)`ed, and provided an instance of the actor to \"run\". During mount, the actor system will initialize the channels, and spawn the underlying embassy task. Once spawned, the actors Address is made available. As with any embassy application, the entry point is specified using an async function marked with #[embassy::main], and it will be passed a Spawner that is passed to each actor context mount(…​). In some cases, it may be desirable to have two or more actors involve in a single semantic component or package. The Package trait may be implemented for any type. An actor must implement the Actor trait, which will allow it to be spawned by the Embassy executor. An actor providing an atomic counter using the above driver is shown below: #![feature(type_alias_impl_trait)] #![feature(generic_associated_types)] use drogue_device::*; pub struct AtomicCounter { counter: MyCounter } pub enum CounterMessage { Increment, Add(u32), } #[actor] impl Actor for AtomicCounter { type Message = CounterMessage; async fn on_mount(&mut self, _: Address, mut inbox: M) where M: Inbox { loop { if let Some(mut m) = inbox.next().await { match *m.message() { CounterMessage::Increment => self.counter.increment().await, CounterMessage::Add(value) => self.counter.add(*value).await, } } } } } Notice the actor attribute, which handles a lot of the boilerplate of writing actors. This actor expands the code to the following: impl Actor for AtomicCounter { type Message = CounterMessage; type OnMountFuture = impl Future + 'm; fn on_mount( &'m mut self, _: Address, inbox: &'m mut M, ) -> Self::OnMountFuture where M: Inbox + 'm { async move { loop { if let Some(mut m) = inbox.next().await { match *m.message() { CounterMessage::Increment => self.counter.increment().await, CounterMessage::Add(value) => self.counter.add(*value).await, } } } } } } Once Rust has native support for async traits, the attribute will no longer be necessary. Although a very complex way to implement an atomic counter, it gives you an idea of how actors provide exclusive access to a resource.","title":"Actors","component":"drogue-device","version":"dev","name":"concepts","url":"/drogue-device/dev/concepts.html","titles":[{"text":"Drogue Actor Model","hash":"_drogue_actor_model","id":1},{"text":"Async","hash":"_async","id":2},{"text":"Messages","hash":"_messages","id":3},{"text":"Addresses","hash":"_addresses","id":4},{"text":"Lifecycle","hash":"_lifecycle","id":5},{"text":"Bootstrap","hash":"_bootstrap","id":6},{"text":"Packages","hash":"_packages","id":7},{"text":"Writing an Actor","hash":"_writing_an_actor","id":8}]},"167":{"id":167,"text":"Async Drivers follow a common set of patterns that makes it easier to write new drivers. Device drivers can be written in different ways, but the common approach is to implement one or more of the following: Create a new Rust crate that implements the driver. Implement traits from embedded-hal-async if relevant. Unfortunately, the support in Rust for writing async traits is limited, but it is possible using features from Rust nightly. An async trait can be specified by enabling a feature named generic associcated types (GAT): #![feature(generic_associated_types)] pub trait Counter { type IncrementFuture: Future where Self: 'm; fn increment(&'m mut self) -> Self::IncrementFuture; type AddFuture: Future where Self: 'm; fn add(&'m mut self, value: u32) -> Self::AddFuture; } An implementor of the above trait will be able to write async code with some boilerplate, and application code can rely on the trait. A driver is an implementation of the trait that applications use. With the trait defined in the previous section, lets take a look at what a driver would look like: #![feature(type_alias_impl_trait)] #![feature(generic_associated_types)] pub struct MyCounter { value: u32, } impl Counter for MyCounter { type IncrementFuture = impl Future + 'm; fn increment(&'m mut self) -> Self::IncrementFuture { async move { self.value += 1; self.value } } type AddFuture = impl Future + 'm; fn add(&'m mut self, value: u32) -> Self::AddFuture { async move { self.value += value; self.value } } } You’ll notice that we’ve used yet another nightly feature that allows specifying the IncrementFuture associated type using the impl Future syntax. At the expense of needing to define the associated type and a somewhat awkward return value, the driver can write blocks of async code to implement the trait.","title":"Drivers","component":"drogue-device","version":"dev","name":"drivers","url":"/drogue-device/dev/drivers.html","titles":[{"text":"Writing async drivers","hash":"_writing_async_drivers","id":1},{"text":"Writing an async trait","hash":"_writing_an_async_trait","id":2},{"text":"Writing an async driver","hash":"_writing_an_async_driver","id":3}]},"168":{"id":168,"text":"There are several examples for different chips to show how drogue device can be used.

In a world without memory management or operating system it is more important than ever to avoid memory corruption and undefined behavior. Rust is an efficient, memory safe and thread safe programming language. Embedded systems must make efficient uses of the resources available. At the same time, having a programming model that fits embedded devices is important. Embassy, the embedded async project, delivers a fast and small runtime and hardware abstraction layer that also provides a great programming experience. Code reuse and composition should be first class in embedded software! Use async task-based or actor-based programming models for writing efficient and composable applications. With actors, you can reuse application logic and compose other actors to build new functionality. Many developers just want to have drivers and functionality ready to be used so they can focus on their application. Drogue Device provides out of the box examples for WiFi, LoRaWAN, BLE combined with different sensors available on boards. Some of the examples are ready to be used with Drogue Cloud. All software is licensed under the Apache 2.0 open source license, no contributor agreement required.","title":"Drogue Device","component":"drogue-device","version":"dev","name":"index","url":"/drogue-device/dev/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Robustness","hash":"_robustness","id":1},{"text":"Efficiency","hash":"_efficiency","id":2},{"text":"Composition","hash":"_composition","id":3},{"text":"IoT Ready","hash":"_iot_ready","id":4},{"text":"Open Source","hash":"_open_source","id":5}]},"179":{"id":179,"text":"async and actors are not concepts commonly familiar to embedded developers, and have usually been associated with programming languages not suitable for embedded. With Rust, this is about to change, as Rust allows you to use these techniques without the traditional overhead associated with it. Software written without async may block on I/O operations. In an std environment, such as a PC, software can handle this either by using threads or non-blocking operations. With threads, one thread blocks on an I/O operation, another is able to take its place. However, even on a PC, threads are relatively heavy, and therefore some programming languages, such as Go, have implemented a concept called coroutines or 'goroutines' that are much lighter and less-intensive than threads. The other way to handle blocking I/O operations is to support polling the state of the underlying peripherals to check whether it is available to perform the requested operation. In programming languages without builtin async support, this requires building a complex loop checking for events. In Rust, non-blocking operations can be implemented using async-await. Async-await works by transforming each async function into an object called a future. When a future blocks on I/O the future yields, and the scheduler, called an executor, can select a different future to execute. Compared to alternatives such as an RTOS, async can yield better performance and lower power consumption because the executor doesn’t have to guess when a future is ready to execute. However, program size may be higher than other alternatives, which may be a problem for certain space-constrained devices with very low memory. On the devices Embassy supports, such as stm32 and nrf, memory is generally large enough to accommodate the modestly-increased program size. Actors make it convenient to write stateful concurrent systems using message passing. Actors only process one message at a time, and communicate with other actors by sending messages to their addresses. Actors compose easily due to their decoupled nature, making it easier to maintain an expanding code base. Actors in drogue-actor are async, which means that they process messages using async-await support in Rust. This does not mean you have to write async code, but you will have the option to do so. The async book is a great way to learn more about async Rust. Read more about actors here. Tasks are a good fit if: You are doing 'standalone' work that doesn’t require any input from other parts of your application You are not going to reuse the task functionality in multiple applications Actors are a good fit if: You want to run a process that handles messages through a channel You want to reuse this process in multiple applications or for multiple purposes You like the ability to compose your application and isolate the business logic in different units","title":"Introduction","component":"drogue-device","version":"dev","name":"introduction","url":"/drogue-device/dev/introduction.html","titles":[{"text":"What is async","hash":"_what_is_async","id":1},{"text":"What is an actor","hash":"_what_is_an_actor","id":2},{"text":"Actors vs Tasks","hash":"_actors_vs_tasks","id":3}]},"180":{"id":180,"text":"The examples are grouped by chip family, then board, then variant.

If the packet gets lost, you’ll see a no response type of output. This is where we are currently. If the packet goes lost, no retransmits of config stuff happens (yet) so just keep repeating it until you a response if you’ve successfully provisioned. If the board complains about nRF Softdevice interrupts being disabled for too long, that’s because of the debug output using too much critical sections. You can reduce the log level or just try again. If you want to start back from scratch, alter the main.rs to use the .force_reset() line (once) which will factory-reset the board. On the pi side, after menu config and setting the target to the board: [config: Target = 00d9]# node-reset This will remove it from the DB. You can then back and do the discover-unprovisioned on and the provision $UUID bits again.","title":"","component":"drogue-device","version":"dev","name":"README","url":"/drogue-device/dev/examples/nrf52/nrf52840-dk/ble-mesh/README.html","titles":[{"text":"nRF 52840 Bluetooth Mesh Example","hash":"_nrf_52840_bluetooth_mesh_example","id":1},{"text":"Raspberry Pi with Bluetooth","hash":"_raspberry_pi_with_bluetooth","id":2},{"text":"First manually stop the existing bluetoothd","hash":"_first_manually_stop_the_existing_bluetoothd","id":3},{"text":"Secondly, on the Pi, use mesh-cfgclient","hash":"_secondly_on_the_pi_use_mesh_cfgclient","id":4},{"text":"On the board","hash":"_on_the_board","id":5},{"text":"If that fails…​","hash":"_if_that_fails","id":6},{"text":"Provision!","hash":"_provision","id":7},{"text":"On the pi, running mesh-cfgclient:","hash":"_on_the_pi_running_mesh_cfgclient","id":8},{"text":"Do Stuff","hash":"_do_stuff","id":9},{"text":"What might go wrong","hash":"_what_might_go_wrong","id":10}]},"195":{"id":195,"text":"This example application runs out of the box on the Raspberry Pi Pico.

Let’s go through a simple Embassy application for the nRF52 DK to understand it better. The full example can be found here. The first thing you’ll notice is a few declarations stating that Embassy requires some nightly features: #![no_std] #![no_main] #![feature(type_alias_impl_trait)] Then, what follows are some declarations on how to deal with panics and faults. During development, a good practice is to rely on defmt-rtt and panic-probe to print diagnostics to the terminal: use defmt::*; use embassy::executor::Spawner; After a bit of import declaration, the tasks run by the application should be declared: led.set_low(); Timer::after(interval).await; } } #[embassy::main] async fn main(spawner: Spawner, p: Peripherals) { let led = Output::new(p.P0_13, Level::Low, OutputDrive::Standard); unwrap!(spawner.spawn(blinker(led, Duration::from_millis(300)))); } An embassy task must be declared async, and may NOT take generic arguments. In this case, we are handed the LED that should be blinked and the interval of the blinking. Notice that there is no busy waiting going on in this task. It is using the Embassy timer to yield execution, allowing the microcontroller to sleep in between the blinking. The main entry point of an Embassy application is defined using the #[embassy::main] macro. The entry point is also required to take a Spawner and a Peripherals argument. The Spawner is the way the main application spawns other tasks. The Peripherals type holds all peripherals that the application may use. In this case, we want to configure one of the pins as a GPIO output driving the LED: #[embassy::main] takes an optional config paramter specifying a function that returns an instance of HAL’s Config struct. For example: fn embassy_config() -> embassy_nrf::config::Config { embassy_nrf::config::Config::default() } #[embassy::main(config = \"embassy_config()\")] async fn main(_spawner: embassy::executor::Spawner, p: embassy_nrf::Peripherals) { // ... } What happens when the blinker task have been spawned and main returns? Well, the main entry point is actually just like any other task, except that you can only have one and it takes some specific type arguments. The magic lies within the #[embassy::main] macro. The macro does the following: Creates an Embassy Executor instance Initializes the microcontroller to get the Peripherals Defines a main task for the entry point Runs the executor spawning the main task There is also a way to run the executor without using the macro, in which case you have to create the Executor instance yourself. The project definition needs to contain the embassy dependencies: embassy = { version = \"0.1.0\", path = \"../../../../../embassy\", features = [\"defmt\", \"nightly\"] } embassy-nrf = { version = \"0.1.0\", path = \"../../../../../embassy-nrf\", features = [\"defmt\", \"nrf52840\", \"time-driver-rtc1\", \"gpiote\", \"nightly\"] } Depending on your microcontroller, you may need to replace embassy-nrf with something else (embassy-stm32 for STM32. Remember to update feature flags as well). In this particular case, the nrf52840 chip is selected, and the RTC1 peripheral is used as the time driver.","title":"A basic Embassy application","component":"embassy","version":"dev","name":"basic_application","url":"/embassy/dev/basic_application.html","titles":[{"text":"Main","hash":"_main","id":1},{"text":"Rust Nightly","hash":"_rust_nightly","id":2},{"text":"Dealing with errors","hash":"_dealing_with_errors","id":3},{"text":"Task declaration","hash":"_task_declaration","id":4},{"text":"Main","hash":"_main_2","id":5},{"text":"The Cargo.toml","hash":"_the_cargo_toml","id":6}]},"208":{"id":208,"text":"embassy-boot a lightweight bootloader supporting firmware application upgrades in a power-fail-safe way, with trial boots and rollbacks. The bootloader can be used either as a library or be flashed directly if you are happy with the default configuration and capabilities. By design, the bootloader does not provide any network capabilities. Networking capabilities for fetching new firmware can be provided by the user application, using the bootloader as a library for updating the firmware, or by using the bootloader as a library and adding this capability yourself. The bootloader supports both internal and external flash by relying on the embedded-storage traits. The bootloader supports nRF52 with and without softdevice STM32 L4, WB, WL, L1, L0, F3, F7 and H7 In general, the bootloader works on any platform that implements the embedded-storage traits for its internal flash, but may require custom initialization code to work. The bootloader divides the storage into 4 main partitions, configured by a linker script: BOOTLOADER - Where the bootloader is placed. The bootloader itself consumes about 8kB of flash. ACTIVE - Where the main application is placed. The bootloader will attempt to load the application at the start of this partition. This partition is only written to by the bootloader. DFU - Where the application-to-be-swapped is placed. This partition is written to by the application. BOOTLOADER STATE - Where the bootloader stores the current state describing if the active and dfu partitions need to be swapped. When the new firmware has been written to the DFU partition, a flag is set to instruct the bootloader that the partitions should be swapped. The partitions for ACTIVE (+BOOTLOADER), DFU and BOOTLOADER_STATE may be placed in separate flash. The page size used by the bootloader is determined by the lowest common multiple of the ACTIVE and DFU page sizes. The BOOTLOADER_STATE partition must be big enough to store one word per page in the ACTIVE and DFU partitions combined. The bootloader has a platform-agnostic part, which implements the power fail safe swapping algorithm given the boundaries set by the partitions. The platform-specific part is a minimal shim that provides additional functionality such as watchdogs or supporting the nRF52 softdevice.","title":"Bootloader","component":"embassy","version":"dev","name":"bootloader","url":"/embassy/dev/bootloader.html","titles":[{"text":"Hardware support","hash":"_hardware_support","id":1},{"text":"Design","hash":"_design","id":2}]},"209":{"id":209,"text":"Embassy provides examples for all HALs supported.

Software written without async may block on I/O operations. In an std environment, such as a PC, software can handle this either by using threads or non-blocking operations. With threads, one thread blocks on an I/O operation, another is able to take its place. However, even on a PC, threads are relatively heavy, and therefore some programming languages, such as Go, have implemented a concept called coroutines or 'goroutines' that are much lighter and less-intensive than threads. The other way to handle blocking I/O operations is to support polling the state of the underlying peripherals to check whether it is available to perform the requested operation. In programming languages without builtin async support, this requires building a complex loop checking for events. In Rust, non-blocking operations can be implemented using async-await. Async-await works by transforming each async function into an object called a future. When a future blocks on I/O the future yields, and the scheduler, called an executor, can select a different future to execute. Compared to alternatives such as an RTOS, async can yield better performance and lower power consumption because the executor doesn’t have to guess when a future is ready to execute. However, program size may be higher than other alternatives, which may be a problem for certain space-constrained devices with very low memory. On the devices Embassy supports, such as stm32 and nrf, memory is generally large enough to accommodate the modestly-increased program size. Embassy is an executor and a Hardware Access Layer (HAL). The executor is a scheduler that generally executes a fixed number of tasks, allocated at startup, though more can be added later. The HAL is an API that you can use to access peripherals, such as USART, UART, I2C, SPI, CAN, and USB. Embassy provides implementations of both async and blocking APIs where it makes sense. DMA (Direct Memory Access) is an example where async is a good fit, whereas GPIO states are a better fit for a blocking API. Embassy may also provide a system timer that you can use for both async and blocking delays. For less than one microsecond, blocking delays should be used because the cost of context-switching is too high and the executor will be unable to provide accurate timing.","title":"Embassy","component":"embassy","version":"dev","name":"index","url":"/embassy/dev/index.html","titles":[{"text":"What is async?","hash":"_what_is_async","id":1},{"text":"What is Embassy?","hash":"_what_is_embassy","id":2}]},"213":{"id":213,"text":"If you’re new to Embassy, it can be overwhelming to grasp all the terminology and concepts. This guide aims to clarify the different layers in Embassy, which problem each layer solves for the application writer. This guide uses the STM32 IOT01A board, but should be easy to translate to any STM32 chip. For nRF, the PAC itself is not maintained within the Embassy project, but the concepts and the layers are similar. The application we’ll write is a simple 'push button, blink led' application, which is great for illustrating input and output handling for each of the examples we’ll go through. We’ll start at the Peripheral Access Crate (PAC) example and end at the async example. The PAC is the lowest API for accessing peripherals and registers, if you don’t count reading/writing directly to memory addresses. It provide distinct types to make accessing peripheral registers easier, but it does not prevent you from writing unsafe code. Writing an application using the PAC directly is therefore not recommended, but if the functionality you want to use is not exposed in the upper layers, that’s what you need to use. The blinky app using PAC is shown below: #![no_std] #![no_main] use pac::gpio::vals; use {defmt_rtt as _, panic_probe as _, stm32_metapac as pac}; #[cortex_m_rt::entry] fn main() -> ! { // Enable GPIO clock let rcc = pac::RCC; unsafe { rcc.ahb2enr().modify(|w| { w.set_gpioben(true); w.set_gpiocen(true); }); rcc.ahb2rstr().modify(|w| { w.set_gpiobrst(true); w.set_gpiocrst(true); w.set_gpiobrst(false); w.set_gpiocrst(false); }); } // Setup button let gpioc = pac::GPIOC; const BUTTON_PIN: usize = 13; unsafe { gpioc.pupdr().modify(|w| w.set_pupdr(BUTTON_PIN, vals::Pupdr::PULLUP)); gpioc.otyper().modify(|w| w.set_ot(BUTTON_PIN, vals::Ot::PUSHPULL)); gpioc.moder().modify(|w| w.set_moder(BUTTON_PIN, vals::Moder::INPUT)); } // Setup LED let gpiob = pac::GPIOB; const LED_PIN: usize = 14; unsafe { gpiob.pupdr().modify(|w| w.set_pupdr(LED_PIN, vals::Pupdr::FLOATING)); gpiob.otyper().modify(|w| w.set_ot(LED_PIN, vals::Ot::PUSHPULL)); gpiob.moder().modify(|w| w.set_moder(LED_PIN, vals::Moder::OUTPUT)); } // Main loop loop { unsafe { if gpioc.idr().read().idr(BUTTON_PIN) == vals::Idr::LOW { gpiob.bsrr().write(|w| w.set_bs(LED_PIN, true)); } else { gpiob.bsrr().write(|w| w.set_br(LED_PIN, true)); } } } } As you can see, there are a lot of code needed to enable the peripheral clocks, configuring the input pins and the output pins of the application. Another downside of this application is that it is busy-looping while polling the button state. This prevents the microcontroller from utilizing any sleep mode to save power. To simplify our application, we can use the HAL instead. The HAL exposes higher level APIs that handle details such Automatically enabling the peripheral clock when you’re using the peripheral Deriving and applying register configuration from higher level types Implementing the embedded-hal traits to make peripherals useful in third party drivers The HAL example is shown below: #![no_std] #![no_main] use cortex_m_rt::entry; use embassy_stm32::gpio::{Input, Level, Output, Pull, Speed}; use {defmt_rtt as _, panic_probe as _}; #[entry] fn main() -> ! { let p = embassy_stm32::init(Default::default()); let mut led = Output::new(p.PB14, Level::High, Speed::VeryHigh); let button = Input::new(p.PC13, Pull::Up); loop { if button.is_low() { led.set_high(); } else { led.set_low(); } } } As you can see, the application becomes a lot simpler, even without using any async code. The Input and Output hides all the details accessing the GPIO registers, and allow you to use a much simpler API to query the state of the button and toggle the LED output accordingly. The same downside from the PAC example still applies though: the application is busy looping and consuming more power than necessary. To save power, we need to configure the application so that it can be notified when the button is pressed using an interrupt. Once the interrupt is configured, the application can instruct the microcontroller to enter a sleep mode, consuming very little power. Given Embassy focus on async Rust (which we’ll come back to after this example), the example application must use a combination of the HAL and PAC in order to use interrupts. For this reason, the application also contains some helper functions to access the PAC (not shown below). #![no_std] #![no_main] use core::cell::RefCell; use cortex_m::interrupt::Mutex; use cortex_m::peripheral::NVIC; use cortex_m_rt::entry; use embassy_stm32::gpio::{Input, Level, Output, Pin, Pull, Speed}; use embassy_stm32::peripherals::{PB14, PC13}; use embassy_stm32::{interrupt, pac}; use {defmt_rtt as _, panic_probe as _}; static BUTTON: Mutex>>> = Mutex::new(RefCell::new(None)); static LED: Mutex>>> = Mutex::new(RefCell::new(None)); #[entry] fn main() -> ! { let p = embassy_stm32::init(Default::default()); let led = Output::new(p.PB14, Level::Low, Speed::Low); let mut button = Input::new(p.PC13, Pull::Up); cortex_m::interrupt::free(|cs| unsafe { enable_interrupt(&mut button); LED.borrow(cs).borrow_mut().replace(led); BUTTON.borrow(cs).borrow_mut().replace(button); NVIC::unmask(pac::Interrupt::EXTI15_10); }); loop { cortex_m::asm::wfe(); } } #[interrupt] fn EXTI15_10() { cortex_m::interrupt::free(|cs| { let mut button = BUTTON.borrow(cs).borrow_mut(); let button = button.as_mut().unwrap(); let mut led = LED.borrow(cs).borrow_mut(); let led = led.as_mut().unwrap(); if check_interrupt(button) { if button.is_low() { led.set_high(); } else { led.set_low(); } } clear_interrupt(button); }); } // // // The simple application is now more complex again, primarily because of the need to keep the button and LED states in the global scope where it is accessible by the main application loop, as well as the interrupt handler. To do that, the types must be guarded by a mutex, and interrupts must be disabled whenever we are accessing this global state to gain access to the peripherals. Luckily, there is an elegant solution to this problem when using Embassy. It’s time to use the Embassy capabilities to its fullest. At the core, Embassy has an async excecutor, or a runtime for async tasks if you will. The executor polls a set of tasks (defined at compile time), and whenever a task blocks, the executor will run another task, or put the microcontroller to sleep. #![no_std] #![no_main] #![feature(type_alias_impl_trait)] use embassy::executor::Spawner; use embassy_stm32::exti::ExtiInput; use embassy_stm32::gpio::{Input, Level, Output, Pull, Speed}; use embassy_stm32::Peripherals; use {defmt_rtt as _, panic_probe as _}; #[embassy::main] async fn main(_s: Spawner, p: Peripherals) { let mut led = Output::new(p.PB14, Level::Low, Speed::VeryHigh); let mut button = ExtiInput::new(Input::new(p.PC13, Pull::Up), p.EXTI13); loop { button.wait_for_any_edge().await; if button.is_low() { led.set_high(); } else { led.set_low(); } } } The async version looks very similar to the HAL version, apart from a few minor details: The main entry point is annotated with a different macro and has an async type signature. This macro creates and starts an Embassy runtime instance and launches the main application task. Using the Spawner instance, the application may spawn other tasks. The peripheral initialization is done by the main macro, and is handed to the main task. Before checking the button state, the application is awaiting a transition in the pin state (low → high or high → low). When button.await_for_any_edge().await is called, the executor will pause the main task and put the microcontroller in sleep mode, unless there are other tasks that can run. Internally, the Embassy HAL has configured the interrupt handler for the button (in ExtiButton), so that whenever an interrupt is raised, the task awaiting the button will be woken up. The minimal overhead of the executor and the ability to run multiple tasks \"concurrently\" combined with the enormous simplification of the application, makes async a great fit for embedded. We have seen how the same application can be written at the different abstraction levels in Embassy. First starting out at the PAC level, then using the HAL, then using interrupts, and then using interrupts indirectly using async Rust.","title":"Embassy layer by layer","component":"embassy","version":"dev","name":"layer_by_layer","url":"/embassy/dev/layer_by_layer.html","titles":[{"text":"PAC version","hash":"_pac_version","id":1},{"text":"HAL version","hash":"_hal_version","id":2},{"text":"Interrupt driven","hash":"_interrupt_driven","id":3},{"text":"Async version","hash":"_async_version","id":4},{"text":"Summary","hash":"_summary","id":5}]},"214":{"id":214,"text":"The Embassy nRF HAL is based on the PACs (Peripheral Access Crate) from nrf-rs.

Integrated timer queue: sleeping is easy, just do Timer::after(Duration::from_secs(1)).await;. No busy-loop polling: CPU sleeps when there’s no work to do, using interrupts or WFE/SEV. Efficient polling: a wake will only poll the woken task, not all of them. Fair: a task can’t monopolize CPU time even if it’s constantly being woken. All other tasks get a chance to run before a given task gets polled for the second time. Creating multiple executor instances is supported, to run tasks with multiple priority levels. This allows higher-priority tasks to preempt lower-priority tasks. The executor function is described below. The executor keeps a queue of tasks that it should poll. When a task is created, it is polled (1). The task will attempt to make progress until it reaches a point where it would be blocked. This may happen whenever a task is .await’ing an async function. When that happens, the task yields execution by (2) returning Poll::Pending. Once a task yields, the executor enqueues the task at the end of the run queue, and proceeds to (3) poll the next task in the queue. When a task is finished or canceled, it will not be enqueued again. The executor relies on tasks not blocking indefinitely, as this prevents the executor to regain control and schedule another task. If you use the #[embassy::main] macro in your application, it creates the Executor for you and spawns the main entry point as the first task. You can also create the Executor manually, and you can in fact create multiple Executors. Interrupts are a common way for peripherals to signal completion of some operation and fits well with the async execution model. The following diagram describes a typical application flow where (1) a task is polled and is attempting to make progress. The task then (2) instructs the peripheral to perform some operation, and awaits. After some time has passed, (3) an interrupt is raised, marking the completion of the operation. The peripheral HAL then (4) ensures that interrupt signals are routed to to the peripheral and updating the peripheral state with the results of the operation. The executor is then (5) notified that the task should be polled, which it will do. There exists a special executor named InterruptExecutor which can be driven by an interrupt. This can be used to drive tasks at different priority levels by creating multiple InterruptExecutor instances. Embassy features an internal timer queue enabled by the time feature flag. When enabled, Embassy assumes a time Driver implementation existing for the platform. Embassy provides time drivers for the nRF, STM32, RPi Pico, WASM and Std platforms. The timer driver implementations for the embedded platforms might support only a fixed number of alarms that can be set. Make sure the number of tasks you expect wanting to use the timer at the same time do not exceed this limit. The timer speed is configurable at compile time using the time-tick-. At present, the timer may be configured to run at 1000 Hz, 32768 Hz, or 1 MHz. Before changing the defaults, make sure the target HAL supports the particular frequency setting. If you do not require timers in your application, not enabling the time feature can save some CPU cycles and reduce power usage.","title":"Embassy runtime","component":"embassy","version":"dev","name":"runtime","url":"/embassy/dev/runtime.html","titles":[{"text":"Features","hash":"_features","id":1},{"text":"Executor","hash":"_executor","id":2},{"text":"Interrupts","hash":"_interrupts","id":3},{"text":"Time","hash":"_time","id":4}]},"216":{"id":216,"text":"The Embassy STM32 HAL is based on the stm32-metapac project.

Unless you really know what you are doing, it is recommended to complete this workshop before anything else. These workshops should run on all operating systems. However, testing them on all variations is a time-consuming task. We mostly test on Linux and macOS. Windows should work as well but is, most likely, less tested. Should you encounter some issues, pull-requests are always welcome ;-) Some workshops may require a specific version of Drogue IoT Cloud. When you self-host an instance, you can pick a specific version. However, in many cases you can also use the community hosted sandbox instance. The sandbox will always run the most recent, released version of Drogue IoT Cloud. You are welcome to contribute to this repository. Contributing can come in multiple ways, including constructive feedback, fixes, enhancements, or new content. Should you consider to adding new works-shops, we would as to reach out to us first. And, be committed on supporting them in the future.","title":"Introduction","component":"drogue-workshops","version":"master","name":"index","url":"/drogue-workshops/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Supported operating systems","hash":"_supported_operating_systems","id":1},{"text":"Drogue IoT Cloud version","hash":"_drogue_iot_cloud_version","id":2},{"text":"Contributing","hash":"_contributing","id":3}]},"219":{"id":219,"text":"The Telemetry end-to-end example is a package of the Eclipse IoT Packages™ project.

It should set you up with all tools and technologies that are required by all the other workshops. It is recommended to finish this workshop first, before diving into the others. A local computer The ability to install new application to your local machine Access to a Drogue IoT cloud instance A working internet connection Most likely, you are reading this already on a computer. For the tutorials a normal desktop computer should work just fine. Linux, macOS, Windows should be fine. Tablets and mobile phones will not be sufficient. If you want to self-host Drogue IoT on your local machine, you can do that too, but you will need considerably more RAM and CPU. For most workshops, you will need access to a Drogue IoT cloud instance. You can self-host one, even on a local machine using e.g. Kind or Minikube. Of course, you can also use our sandbox cluster. The sandbox cluster is a community hosted instance. Be nice, don’t break it. And, accept when it is down. It may also be, that we reset the instance every now and then, and all your data stored on it is lost. In order to configure cloud side components, we will use the drg command line tool. Technically the Drogue IoT Cloud offers a REST API, and you could simply use curl or http too. However, this makes examples rather verbose, and less understandable. All possible ways of installing are described in the drg repository: https://github.com/drogue-iot/drg#installation If you already have cargo and a Rust toolchain installed, you can simply execute: cargo install drg You can also download a pre-compiled binary from the releases page. Navigate your web browser to the console URL of your Drogue IoT Cloud instance. For the sandbox, this would be https://sandbox.drogue.cloud. Depending on the installation, you need to have some local user credentials, create a new account, or sign up with an external identity provider, like GitHub. Next, you will need to log in with drg to the instance as well. Run the following command: drg login For the sandbox, this would be: drg login https://api.sandbox.drogue.cloud drg login will open a browser window, to let you start the OpenID Connect login flow. This is required, as the Drogue Cloud instance may be paired with an external identity provider, like GitHub. Once the login is completed, you will be directed to the Drogue Cloud, which will then redirect to the local drg instance, receiving the OAuth2 access token. From now on, drg has access to your Drogue Cloud instance. When the access token expires, it will automatically fetch a fresh token, using the stored refresh token. Your password, is not stored locally. You can see which contexts you have created by: drg context list This will print out a list of known contexts on your system. To set a new active context, run: drg context set-active An application is a main resource in Drogue Cloud. It will contain devices, and provide access to data. Creating a new application is simply, and can be done by executing: drg create app my-app Application names are unique in the system. Workshops may use an application name like my-app, which may already be used by another use. In this case, you will need to select a different name. Same as creating a new application, you can create a new device too: drg create device --app my-app my-device As you can see, devices are scoped by applications. So, when creating a new device, you will also need to provide the application you want to create it in. Device names are unique too, however they need to be unique for an application. It is possible to have device1 as part of app1 and as part of app2. These are two distinct devices. Applications and devices can contain additional information like credentials, configurations, status. You can view and edit this information. From the command line, execute: drg get device --app my-app my-device This should print out something like: { \"metadata\": { \"application\": \"my-app\", \"creationTimestamp\": \"2021-04-30T08:36:41.982194Z\", \"generation\": 0, \"name\": \"my-device\", \"resourceVersion\": \"d2ca3370-49d8-4546-b1ac-960a4a7689ef\", \"uid\": \"5b10e583-8498-4697-8e0d-7ebd35496e91\" } } This might indeed remind you of Kubernetes. We tried to model the data structures similar to Kubernetes'. However, we didn’t blindly copy the structures, only adopted them where it made sense for our use case. When you see something that looks familiar, it is. Just don’t expect all other Kubernetes concept to be present as well. You can interactively edit a resource be executing: drg edit device --app my-app my-device This will load the current state, and open it in a local text editor. Once you save and close the editor, it will update the resource in the cloud. Finally, we can also delete a resource. Let’s just delete the whole application: Deleting the application will delete the application and all its devices. There is no way to bring them back. drg delete app my-app This will start by deleting devices, and then the application. It will also make the name available for others to use it. However, devices will still be deleted, when re-creating an appliction with the same name.","title":"Getting started","component":"drogue-workshops","version":"master","name":"index","url":"/drogue-workshops/getting-started/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Pre-requisites","hash":"_pre_requisites","id":1},{"text":"A local computer","hash":"_a_local_computer","id":2},{"text":"Access to a Drogue IoT cloud instance","hash":"_access_to_a_drogue_iot_cloud_instance","id":3},{"text":"Install the command line client","hash":"_install_the_command_line_client","id":4},{"text":"Install using cargo","hash":"_install_using_cargo","id":5},{"text":"Downloading a pre-compiled binary","hash":"_downloading_a_pre_compiled_binary","id":6},{"text":"Create an account in Drogue IoT Cloud","hash":"_create_an_account_in_drogue_iot_cloud","id":7},{"text":"Log in with drg","hash":"_log_in_with_drg","id":8},{"text":"Managing contexts","hash":"_managing_contexts","id":9},{"text":"Creating a new application","hash":"_creating_a_new_application","id":10},{"text":"Creating a new device","hash":"_creating_a_new_device","id":11},{"text":"Viewing and editing resources","hash":"_viewing_and_editing_resources","id":12},{"text":"Viewing the current state","hash":"_viewing_the_current_state","id":13},{"text":"Editing a resource","hash":"_editing_a_resource","id":14},{"text":"Deleting a resource","hash":"_deleting_a_resource","id":15}]},"221":{"id":221,"text":"So far, we have run the application locally, and then deployed it to the cloud. However, we could move our workflow even more to the cloud. In the next steps, will build and deploy in the cloud, and set up a cloud IDE afterwards. For this, you will need an account for the Developer Sandbox for OpenShift. The following steps assume that you have an active instance, and that kubectl or oc are logged in to this instance. Normally you have two namespaces pre-created (you cannot create new namespaces): -dev and -stage. We will use the -stage for deploying the application and leave the -dev to the cloud IDE. The first step is to deploy the same application, but let the OpenShift cluster build the container image. We can deploy this setup, using a Quarkus Helm chart: helm install --repo https://redhat-developer.github.io/redhat-helm-charts \\ my-drogue-quarkus-mqtt-integration quarkus \\ --set build.uri=https://github.com/drogue-iot/quarkus-mqtt-integration-starter (1) 1 The Git repository which will be fed into the build. You can replace this with your own Git repository. Once you ran the Helm chart, the \"Developer\" perspective of OpenShift should show you the current state: Note the ImagePullBackOff error, that is fine for the moment, as the build isn’t complete yet. Once the build is complete, it will trigger a re-deployment and roll out the new (first) version. Once the deployment has been rolled out, you can also click on the \"route\" on the right-hand side: Trigger a new build is easy: Just click on the \"Start Build\" button on the right side. You can also trigger a new build from the command line: oc start-build my-drogue-quarkus-mqtt-integration This will start a new build, push the image to the internal image registry, and notify the deployment to rollout a new version once the build is complete. Automatic builds You can also trigger builds automatically. Whenever you push to your git repository, it will pick up the change and start the whole process for you. However, setting this up is a bit off-topic for this tutorial. But if you are interested, maybe take a look at: Triggering and modifying builds. Now we can make local modifications, and push changes to our git repository, and build and rollout a new version from that. Cloud IDEs may or may not be your cup of tea. Anyway, let’s explore what we can do with it. Navigate to the CodeReady instance on the Developer Sandbox. From there, you can create a new workspace. Create a new workspace, and use the following URL as \"Devfile\": https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drogue-iot/quarkus-mqtt-integration-starter/main/devfile.yaml By default, the \"Devfile\", will import the original Git repository. Instead of using the URL for creating the workspace, you can also copy and paste the content of the Devfile into the creation screen, and tweak the repository URL to use your own. Starting the workspace may take a minute or two. Once it is ready, it will clone and import the Git repository. During this process, the IDE might offer you to install additional addons: If you like, go ahead and install additional functionality to your workspace. However, all the required plugins are already listed in the \"Devfile\", and so you can skip these offers as well. Once the source code is imported, click on My Workspace Start Development Mode to start a first build. This will trigger an initial Maven build, which may again take a bit until it is compiled: Once the build is finished, the Quarkus Maven plugin will run the application, just like on your local machine. Eclipse Che will ask you if you want to navigate your browser to the started endpoint: You can click on Open In New Tab to open the web frontend in your browser. You just built the example on the cluster itself, running inside a cloud IDE. And on the same cluster, you are running the actual application. Is that better than doing the same on your local machine? Maybe, maybe not. This really depends on your use case and environment. In this case you could simply access the MQTT data stream from a public endpoint. Just assume, that this MQTT stream is not a public one, but hosted inside a local area network. With an on-premise cloud IDE, you could get access from a remote place and develop with the actual stream of data. And if you set up the Git build trigger, then you can commit and push from the cloud IDE, and start a new build and rollout by doing so. This concludes the workshop. There are many things that you can try out next. Maybe show more than one bubble in the Web UI. Or show some more information (like timestamps and device IDs). Do some data processing, like building aggregated values for local regions.","title":"Moving to the cloud","component":"drogue-workshops","version":"master","name":"cloud","url":"/drogue-workshops/quarkus-mqtt-starter/cloud.html","titles":[{"text":"Creating the Quarkus build using Helm","hash":"_creating_the_quarkus_build_using_helm","id":1},{"text":"Rebuilding","hash":"_rebuilding","id":2},{"text":"Cloud IDE","hash":"_cloud_ide","id":3},{"text":"Getting ready","hash":"_getting_ready","id":4},{"text":"A first build","hash":"_a_first_build","id":5},{"text":"What just happened?","hash":"_what_just_happened","id":6},{"text":"What’s next?","hash":"_whats_next","id":7}]},"222":{"id":222,"text":"This workshop focuses on the consumption of telemetry data, coming from the MQTT integration API of Drogue Cloud.

However, it maybe the that the sandbox is down. We will definitely fix this, but it may take a bit. Of course, you can also host your own Drogue IoT cloud instance, and even use Minikube or Kind to do so. The final web dashboard can be viewed with just a web browser, as it is hosted on our sandbox server too. So all that you need is just a web browser. However, if you want to get a bit more hands-on, you might need some additional pre-requisites. For locally running the starter, you will need a standard Java developer setup. A Java 11+ JDK, a code editor or IDE, and the ability to run some commands like mvn. For this, you will of course need a Kubernetes cluster. If a local test deployment is sufficient for you, then you can also use something like Minikube or Kind. Instead of setting up your own cluster, you can also use something like the OpenShift Developer Sandbox. In any case, you will need the kubectl binary on your local machine, and be logged in to your Kubernetes cluster. You can also deploy the code using Helm.

The full code is available at: https://github.com/drogue-iot/quarkus-mqtt-integration-starter/tree/main/src/main but here, we will show some of the most important concepts. A brief overview of the flow of events is: Receiving events from Drogue IoT is done using the MQTT integration. This endpoint of Drogue Cloud is an MQTT server to which an application can connect and subscribe to some specific topics, in order to receive events from the system. It is not a full MQTT broker though, and only provides some dedicates topics and operations, required for this use case. The core logic for receiving events is in the file Receiver.java. @Startup (1) @ApplicationScoped public class Receiver { @Incoming(Channels.DROGUE_INBOUND) @Outgoing(Channels.TELEMETRY) @Broadcast public DeviceEvent process(Message rawMessage ) { (2) // ... } } 1 The receiver is a bean, which is annotated with the @Startup annotation, so that it starts processing events, even if no user has yet to access the web frontend. This is required for this example, as events are already being generated and need to be processed by our logic, so that when a user connects to our application, there will be some existing data to show. This pattern also works in cases where you don’t even have a web frontend, but an application which only processes events in the background. 2 The message you will receive is a raw byte[] message. As Drogue IoT sends out Cloud Events, we need to parse the raw MQTT payload as a cloud event, and then map the payload of the cloud event to the actual payload we expect: var format = EventFormatProvider .getInstance() .resolveFormat(JsonFormat.CONTENT_TYPE); (1) var message = format.deserialize(rawMessage.getPayload()); (2) var mappedMessage = mapData( message, PojoCloudEventDataMapper.from(this.objectMapper, Payload.class) ); (3) var payload = mappedMessage.getValue(); (4) 1 Get the format provider for the Cloud Events JSON format. As we are using MQTT 3.1.1, we are sure that we are using the structural format, which encodes the full cloud event using JSON. 2 Deserialize the message using the format provider. 3 Map the payload of the cloud event to the Java class Payload. 4 Extract the mapped payload from the payload mapper. The actual code is a bit more complex, and properly handles error cases. That is why your local cloned code or the code from the git repository looks a bit more complex. The Receiver bean actually is an event transformer. It transforms the incoming MQTT messages into system internal events. The target event is created by the following section: var device = new DeviceEvent(); var deviceId = message.getExtension(\"device\"); (1) device.setDeviceId(deviceId.toString()); var timestamp = message.getTime(); (1) device.setTimestamp(timestamp.toInstant()); device.setTemperature(payload.getTemperature()); (2) device.setLocation(payload.getGeoloc()); (2) return device; (3) 1 Extracts information from the cloud event’s metadata 2 Extracts information from the payload 3 The resulting, internal, event As the process method is annotated with both the @Inbound and @Outbound annotation, it will receive events but also forward events which are returned by the method. The event which is returned, is sent on internally to the event channel defined by Channels.TELEMETRY. We saw before that events flow in from a channel Channels.DROGUE_INBOUND and leave to a channel named Channels.TELEMETRY. There is a bit more to the channels than just their names. Let’s take a look at the application configuration: application.yaml mp: messaging: # # Configure the MQTT source (we read from it) # incoming: drogue-inbound: (1) type: smallrye-mqtt (2) topic: app/${drogue.integration.application} (3) host: ${drogue.integration.mqtt.host} port: ${drogue.integration.mqtt.port} # # Configure the MQTT sink (we send commands to) # outgoing: drogue-outbound: (1) type: smallrye-mqtt (2) host: ${drogue.integration.mqtt.host} port: ${drogue.integration.mqtt.port} 1 The names of the channels, aligns with the constants in Channels. 2 Declares the channels as \"backed by MQTT\". 3 The inbound topic. For the outbound channel it is possible to provide this \"per message\", and so it may be omitted. Although this examples configures an outbound channel, it is actually not used in this starter. However, it is left in for completeness. As the internal telemetry channel does not have any configuration, it is an internal channel, not backed by any transport technology. The internal component, which consumes these events are actually two: state/CurrentState ui/EventsResource The bean CurrentState simply records the \"last known event\": public class CurrentState { private DeviceEvent lastEvent; @Incoming(Channels.TELEMETRY) (1) public void telemetryChange(final DeviceEvent event) { this.lastEvent = event; (2) } public DeviceEvent getLastEvent() { return this.lastEvent; (3) } } 1 Bind the method to receive events from the internal \"telemetry\" channel. The one we are feeding from the Receiver bean. 2 Simply remember the last known event. 3 Return the last known event when we need it. This example doesn’t make use of the state stored by this bean. In the next section you will see why. But still, this pattern might come in handy for you in other cases. The dashboard is connected to the backend using WebSockets. When the dashboard is loaded, it connects to the backend. Those connections are handled by the EventsResource bean: @ServerEndpoint(\"/ws\") @ApplicationScoped public class EventsResource { private final Map sessions = new ConcurrentHashMap<>(); (1) private Object lastEvent; (2) @OnOpen public void onOpen(Session session) { if (lastEvent != null) { session.getAsyncRemote().sendObject(lastEvent); (3) } sessions.put(session.getId(), session); } @OnClose public void onClose(Session session) { sessions.remove(session.getId()); } @OnError public void onError(Session session, Throwable throwable) { sessions.remove(session.getId()); } @Incoming(Channels.TELEMETRY) void telemetryEvent(DeviceEvent event) { (4) Object nextEvent = new JsonObject() .put(\"type\", \"telemetry\") .put(\"payload\", JsonObject.mapFrom(event)).toString(); this.lastEvent = nextEvent; (5) sessions.values().forEach(s -> { (6) s.getAsyncRemote().sendObject(nextEvent); }); } } 1 The map used to keep track of all connected clients. As the bean is annotated with @ApplicationScoped there will only be one instance of it, and we can track all sessions. 2 The last known state, preformatted for directly sending out to clients. 3 When a new client connects, and we have a previous state, we send it out before anything else. 4 The method which will receive the internal events from the Receiver bean. 5 Remembers the last event formatted for the client. 6 Send out the event to all known clients. We walked through the flow of events and learned how events get processes, converted and consumed in the application. You might want to take a look at the web frontend too. This is just a small HTML page, with some CSS and JavaScript to subscribe to the backend and receive data. The content is located at: main/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/index.html. Maybe you already have some ideas to tweak this. Making changes is easy: take your editor of choice, and go ahead. In some cases, when modifying application global beans, you need to re-start the application, as hot-reloading doesn’t work. Press Ctrl+C and re-run mvn quarkus:dev.","title":"How does it work?","component":"drogue-workshops","version":"master","name":"internals","url":"/drogue-workshops/quarkus-mqtt-starter/internals.html","titles":[{"text":"Receiving events","hash":"_receiving_events","id":1},{"text":"MQTT Events","hash":"_mqtt_events","id":2},{"text":"Processing as a cloud event","hash":"_processing_as_a_cloud_event","id":3},{"text":"Assembling the outbound event","hash":"_assembling_the_outbound_event","id":4},{"text":"Understanding the channel mappings","hash":"_understanding_the_channel_mappings","id":5},{"text":"Consuming events","hash":"_consuming_events","id":6},{"text":"Current state","hash":"_current_state","id":7},{"text":"UI event stream","hash":"_ui_event_stream","id":8},{"text":"What’s next?","hash":"_whats_next","id":9}]},"224":{"id":224,"text":"In order to deploy this to a Kubernetes cluster, we will first need to create a container image for the application. Later on, we will also show how you can build this in the cloud, and automatically re-deploy when you make changes. You can build container images locally. First, ensure that you have an up-to-date Maven build: mvn clean package And then, create a container image from it: docker build -t my-quarkus-mqtt-starter . -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.jvm Of course, you can simply replace the docker command with podman, it works the same way. The previous step created a container image in your local machine. However, when using a Kubernetes cluster, that may not be sufficient. You might need to push the image to a container registry. Reasonable choices are quay.io or GitHub container registry. Assuming you push to quay.io with your user being myaccount, you would need to run the following commands: docker tag my-quarkus-starter quay.io/myaccount/my-quarkus-mqtt-starter:latest docker push quay.io/myaccount/my-quarkus-mqtt-starter:latest In the folder deploy/, you will find some example deployment files. First, if you want to deploy your changed container image, you will need to replace the image name in the file deploy/020-deployment.yaml: kind: Deployment apiVersion: apps/v1 metadata: name: quarkus-mqtt-integration-starter # … spec: # … template: # … spec: containers: - name: service image: ghcr.io/drogue-iot/quarkus-mqtt-integration-starter-jvm:latest (1) imagePullPolicy: Always # … 1 The original name image, which you may replace if you want to deploy your own version For all examples, it is a good idea to use a dedicated namespace, in order to isolate your deployment.

So the web-frontend URL (in this case) would be https://quarkus-mqtt-integration-starter-my-user-stage.apps.sandbox-m2.ll9k.p1.openshiftapps.com You can also use the Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift to directly host this application. Before you start, you will need an Azure account and have the az command installed and connected to your account. This may cost money Deploying the example on Azure may result on costs being billed to your account. You need to understand what the following commands actually do and ensure that you clean up resources after you are finished testing. If in doubt, consider a locally hosted Kubernetes solution like Minikube or Kind. Also see the documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/ If you don’t have a cluster yet, you can create a simple test cluster by executing the following commands. The following steps are an opinionated setup, focused on this specific use case. It follows the quick start instructions for the Azure Kubernetes Service. Also see the documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough az group create --name my-quarkus-mqtt-starter --location eastus az aks create --resource-group my-quarkus-mqtt-starter --name my-quarkus-mqtt-cluster --node-count 1 --enable-addons monitoring,http_application_routing --generate-ssh-keys az aks get-credentials --resource-group my-quarkus-mqtt-starter --name my-quarkus-mqtt-cluster Finally, verify that the cluster is running and that kubectl is properly configured to access it.

The following command will delete the whole resource group without asking for confirmation. Ensure that this is really what you want to do. az group delete --name my-quarkus-mqtt-starter --yes To avoid unexpected charges, manually double check that all resources have indeed been cleaned up. For any other Kubernetes, you will need some kind of Ingress controller, and need to map the ingress traffic to the application Service. Since this is very difference between different Kubernetes providers, it is hard to give a reasonable example. We deployed the application into a Kubernetes cluster, and have it running and processing our data there. Of course, you can start making changes already. If you wait for the next chapter, you might see how you can make this process a bit simpler.","title":"Deploying to Kubernetes","component":"drogue-workshops","version":"master","name":"kubernetes","url":"/drogue-workshops/quarkus-mqtt-starter/kubernetes.html","titles":[{"text":"Creating a container","hash":"_creating_a_container","id":1},{"text":"Pushing images","hash":"_pushing_images","id":2},{"text":"Deploying the application","hash":"_deploying_the_application","id":3},{"text":"OpenShift","hash":"_openshift","id":4},{"text":"Using OpenShift Developer Sandbox","hash":"_using_openshift_developer_sandbox","id":5},{"text":"Azure Kubernetes Service","hash":"_azure_kubernetes_service","id":6},{"text":"Creating a cluster","hash":"_creating_a_cluster","id":7},{"text":"Deploying the application","hash":"_deploying_the_application_2","id":8},{"text":"Routing ingress traffic","hash":"_routing_ingress_traffic","id":9},{"text":"Clean up","hash":"_clean_up","id":10},{"text":"Any other Kubernetes","hash":"_any_other_kubernetes","id":11},{"text":"What’s next?","hash":"_whats_next","id":12}]},"225":{"id":225,"text":"The next step is to run this locally.

Quarkus works together with all kinds of IDEs and editors. In the following sections we will focus on command line usage of tools, like mvn. You know your environment best, so if you dislike using the command line, you can always use equivalent IDE operations instead. Quarkus applications can be started locally by executing the following command, and this application is no different: ./mvnw quarkus:dev This will compile and run the application in debug mode.

Architecture overview Drogue Cloud will receive the telemetry data from the devices. It will authenticate and authorize the devices, normalize the events into \"Cloud Events\", but keep the payload unchanged. The events will be pushed to a Knative serving endpoint. Knative will host an endpoint, which receives Cloud Events, and translates them into insert statement for the Timescale database. TimescaleDB is the database, which will persist the data and serve queries coming from different applications interested in the data, like Grafana. Grafana will act as visualization tool for the data. With the exception of Knative, we do re-use existing services, all managed for us. And even for Knative itself, we re-use an existing service and only need to focus on the actual translation of the data. Using this architecture, we do indeed achieve both: keeping our own, existing data structures, and on-boarding as many managed services as possible at the same time. Some solutions do offer you the ability to convert data using a script language, like JavaScript, in the processing. However, with existing data models and formats, you most likely already have code to process your data, but not necessarily in JavaScript. Or using the limited subset of JavaScript that the solution allows you to use. Having Knative in the mix, you can leverage your full existing portfolio of code, and favorite programming language to do the job. Still, you only need to focus on the actual translation. Deploying, scheduling, and scaling is all part of a Knative. And it will even scale down to zero. So if you don’t use it, you don’t pay for it.","title":"Architecture","component":"drogue-workshops","version":"master","name":"architecture","url":"/drogue-workshops/timeseries-as-a-service/architecture.html","titles":[]},"228":{"id":228,"text":"Drogue Cloud is our IoT connectivity layer. It will offer the IoT specific endpoints, authenticate devices, and normalize events. We will need to perform the following steps: Create a new application Register a new device Finally, send some data Costs We will be using the public Drogue IoT sandbox, which is completely free for trying out Drogue IoT. Log in to the public sandbox console, and navigate to the \"Applications\" view. Create a new application with a unique name and remember that name. Figure 1. New application dialog Once it is created, we need to configure the event source, sending data to our Knative endpoint. For this we need the following information from the previous steps: Public endpoint URL Endpoint token Go to the \"YAML\" tab of the application, and edit the .spec section (create one if there is none): spec: knative: endpoint: url: https://pusher.your-public-url.codeengine.appdomain.cloud (1) auth: bearer: token: abcdef123456 (2) 1 Public URL of Knative endpoint 2 Token configured in the Knative endpoint After storing the configuration, the changes will be applied. After a bit, the state should change back to \"Ready\" and in the YAML section, you should see the condition KnativeReady in the section .status.conditions to become True. Currently, you need to reload the data to see the change. Now we need to register a new device. While we don’t use any physical device, the procedure is the same for simulating one using e.g. curl, http or mqtt. Navigate to the \"Devices\" view, and select your application from the drop-down in the top. Use the New device button to create a new device named device1: Figure 2. Dialog to create a new device The newly created device does not have any credentials assigned, so it currently cannot be used to connect. For the sake of simplicity, we will just add a plain text password to the device. Navigate to the \"YAML\" tab of the device and add the following: spec: credentials: credentials: (1) - pass: my-password (2) 1 Indeed, the credentials field contains another field named credentials. 2 The password, stored plain text Plain text passwords Storing passwords plain text might not be a good idea. Don’t worry, Drogue Cloud can make use of hashed passwords or X.509 client certificates. Using the command line tool drg, you can make use of them pretty easily. But for this tutorial, we wanted to stick to the web browser. We are good to go for a first test. We wired up Drogue Cloud with TimescaleDB using Knative, registered a device, and created a table in the database. So, let’s send some data (be sure to replace the application and password): curl -v -XPOST -u device1@my-application:my-password https://http.sandbox.drogue.cloud/v1/state -d '{\"features\": {\"temperature\":{\"value\":42}}}' If you prefer MQTT, you can do the same using mqtt: mqtt pub -v -h mqtt.sandbox.drogue.cloud -p 443 -u 'device1@my-application' -pw 'my-password' -s -t telemetry -m '{\"features\": {\"temperature\":{\"value\":42}}}' When the command has completed successfully, check the table with psql: tsdb=> select * from temperatures; time | device_id | temperature -------------------------------+-----------+------------- 2022-03-11 16:41:44.799424+00 | device1 | 42 (1 row) tsdb=> Yay! So, we wired it all up and data ends up in the Timescale database. Now comes the fun part, as we want to make use of that data and leverage the powers of TimescaleDB, and draw some nice charts.","title":"Drogue Cloud","component":"drogue-workshops","version":"master","name":"drogue","url":"/drogue-workshops/timeseries-as-a-service/drogue.html","titles":[{"text":"Create application","hash":"_create_application","id":1},{"text":"Register device","hash":"_register_device","id":2},{"text":"Send some data","hash":"_send_some_data","id":3},{"text":"What’s next?","hash":"_whats_next","id":4}]},"229":{"id":229,"text":"Grafana is the tool we use to visualize the data we have in Timescale now. Setting it up will involve the following steps: Create a new Grafana instance Add a datasource Create a new dashboard Costs Grafana offers a \"free plan\", which is sufficient for our workshop. If you already have a Grafana instance, you can of course re-use that instance too. Log in to Grafana Cloud, and add a new stack using one of the Add stack buttons. Select a region that matches the other services and an instance URL that works for you. Once the deployment is ready, just navigate your browser to the instance and sign in. As a first step, we need to let Grafana know where to get data from. So navigate to Configuration Data sources and click the Add data source button. Select the \"PostgreSQL\" data source type, which should be installed by default to your instance. For filling out the form, you will need the following information from the previous steps: TimescaleDB hostname and port Credentials of the \"dashboard\" timescale user Fill out the form: Field Value Description Name Drogue IoT A name for the datasource PostreSQL connection Host host:1234 The hostname and port number of your TimescaleDB instance Database tsdb The database name, normally tsdb User dashboard The username of the \"dashboard\" user Password * The password of the \"dashboard\" user TLS/SSL Mode require Require TLS validation PostreSQL details Version 12+ The PostgreSQL version TimescaleDB true Activate this, as we are connecting to a TimescaleDB instance Min time interval 1s Lower to one second, to get more accurate data All other fields can be left with their default values. Click on the Save & Test button, you should get a confirmation that the connection is ok. The next step is to create a new dashboard, which makes use of the datasource we just added. Click on Create Dashboard in the left sidebar menu and press the Add a new panel button. Grafana allows all kinds of customizations and tweaks. Creating beautiful dashboards can be fun. However, in this workshop we focus on the important point. But if you like, feel free to spend some time in polishing your dashboards. Save early, save often! We don’t mention this explicitly in the following section, but be sure to safe your dashboard occasionally after making changes. This will give you a new chart, with a dummy datasource. Update the datasource and query to show the temperatures value we added previously: Setting Value Description Datasource Drogue IoT The datasource connecting to TimescaleDB FROM temperatures The name of the table Time column time The name of the field containing the timestamp Metric column device_id The name of the metric, in our case, this is the device id SELECT Column: temperature The field of the actual value WHERE Macro: $__timeFilter A macro, creating the where clause which matches the current dashboard time window Leave the other values to their defaults: Figure 1. First panel settings Don’t forget to press the Apply button, so commit the changes to the dashboard and exit the \"Edit panel\" mode. In order to better see when experimenting with data, let’s change the time window to 30 minutes. You can do this in the upper area of the screen: Figure 2. Select time window Also, by default the dashboard does not update data automatically. This can be changed by expanding the drop-down menu of the refresh menu and selecting a refresh period: Figure 3. Select auto-refresh Currently, this query shows all devices at the same time. With Grafana you can allow the user to select one or more devices, to focus more on specific data. Navigate to the dashboard settings (the cogwheel button in the top section of the screen). Then navigate to Settings Variables and add a new variable using the Add variable button. Enter the following information: Setting Value Description General Name device_id The name of the variable Type Query Values are acquired by executing a query Label Device Shows \"Device\" instead of \"device_id\" in the UI Query options Data source Drogue IoT The datasource used for the query Refresh On time range change Refreshes whenever the dashboard is reloaded, so we also get newlyl added devices. Query select distinct device_id from temperatures SQL query to get all device IDs Selection options Multi-value true Allow selecting one or more devices Include All option true Allow selecting \"all\" devices Leave the other fields with their defaults and commit the change using the Update button. We will need to adapt the query, to add the variable as a filter in the where clause. Click on the title of the panel and select the Panel Edit menu entry. This will bring you back to the query settings. Find the row that starts with the WHERE clause, and add a new element by pressing the + button, choose to add an \"Expression\". The first part of the expression is the field, choose device_id by clicking on the section of the element. The second part is the value to test for. Now the value part is a bit trickier. It could be a single device ID, it could be multiple device IDs, or none at all. No worries, SQL has you covered, and you can use the following expression: ANY(ARRAY[$device_id]::varchar[]), which performs a check if the value of the field (device_id) is in the provided array. Which also is true if the array is empty. Apply the changes again. Then you can use the drop-down labeled Device, in the top of the dashboard: Figure 4. Drop-down menu for the device_id variable Add more devices Of course, as the screenshot might already have hinted, this is more fun when adding additional devices. Take a look at the previous sections. Adding more devices should only be a few clicks in the Drogue IoT console now. Also be sure to push some data using the HTTP or MQTT commands. Congratulations. We have our basic setup complete. We have set up all the different components, using managed services in the process. Feel free to play around with this. We have a few ideas what you could try out in the summary of the workshop. However, if you are curious, stick around for the next section, where we dig a bit deeper into the features of TimescaleDB. Showing you what benefits you can get over a standard PostgreSQL database.","title":"Grafana","component":"drogue-workshops","version":"master","name":"grafana","url":"/drogue-workshops/timeseries-as-a-service/grafana.html","titles":[{"text":"Create instance","hash":"_create_instance","id":1},{"text":"Adding a datasource","hash":"_adding_a_datasource","id":2},{"text":"Create dashboard","hash":"_create_dashboard","id":3},{"text":"A first panel","hash":"_a_first_panel","id":4},{"text":"Time window & Auto-reload","hash":"_time_window_auto_reload","id":5},{"text":"Filtering by device","hash":"_filtering_by_device","id":6},{"text":"What’s next?","hash":"_whats_next","id":7}]},"230":{"id":230,"text":"In this workshop, we will take a look at TimescaleDB, a time series database based on PostgreSQL. Consuming measurements from a (simulated) temperate sensor, translating the payload using Knative, and storing the outcome in TimescaleDB. Visualizing the results with Grafana. And while all of these components are open source, and you can self-host any of this, we will use managed services all the way, not only for the time series database. Why? Just to prove that you can have both, the freedom of open source and the comfort of letting someone else maintain the service. Keeping you in control of the data. A common IoT application is to just store telemetry data from sensors and devices into a database, in order to store and analyze it immediately, or at a later time. Measurements coming from IoT devices however are a bit different from other data, which you would store in a database. First of all, this can get massive. Consider the number of sensors you have, times the number of measurements you want to take per time period. If you want to store temperate data for years, in high resolution, in order to be able to create some analytic models and prediction from it, that can take up some amount of space. In addition, IoT measurement data is an approximation in most cases. Sensors quantize the real world, and optimize the data for efficient transmission to some more central location, mainly \"the cloud\", today. Putting back the snippets of data together again on the analytics side requires some mathematical effort. Time series database is specialized for use cases like that. Instead of storing complex relational data, they focus on a series of measurements through time. Allowing for some optimizations when storing data: like compressing redundant information, or organizing data in clusters. At the same time, supporting the user to write queries, helping with factor of time. Just to give a simple example: Consider a temperature measurement, sent to the cloud every second, for thousands of devices. This is easy to store, as you simply need to store a tuple of: timestamp, device, value. Any database can handle this. However, a time series database could collapse redundant information like repeating temperature values, and at the same optimize the query to provide accurate information over the queried time range, including aggregations like a moving average. There is no cloud, just other people’s computers. And of course the time and effort to maintain a service for you. So managed services will have a cost attached. And someone needs to pay for that. Many service providers try to offer you a \"free tier\" or give you a free budget that you can work with. This tutorial will be limited to using \"free\" services only. In some cases this means you will still need to provide a credit card, as in theory, you could go above the free tier usage pattern. Rest assured, we will not. However, if you consider a service to add value to your use case, then consider spending the money. As we will be consuming managed services, you need to sign-up for free tiers on: The Drogue IoT Cloud public sandbox: https://sandbox.drogue.cloud All you need is a GitHub account, in order to sign up for the public sandbox. For Knative, either: An OpenShift developer sandbox instance: https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox/get-started You can go without a credit card for 30 days Or, an IBM cloud account: https://www.ibm.com/cloud/free You will need to register a credit card, as this will unlock more (free) services, mainly \"Code Engine\", which we will require for this tutorial. A TimescaleDB instance: https://www.timescale.com/timescale-signup With Timescale, you will get 30 days free. That is all that we need. Grafana Cloud: https://grafana.com/auth/sign-up/create-user We will use the \"Grafana Cloud Free\" plan for this tutorial. All the sign-op options are pretty straightforward. However, they also involve a few steps each, and may differ depending on who you are and where you are located. And maybe, you are already signed up for any of these services. That is why we don’t provide step-by-step instructions, but hope that the provided links will give you a pointer into the right direction. If you run into any issues, please let us know.","title":"Time series data, using managed services","component":"drogue-workshops","version":"master","name":"index","url":"/drogue-workshops/timeseries-as-a-service/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"Costs","hash":"_costs","id":2},{"text":"Pre-requisites","hash":"_pre_requisites","id":3}]},"231":{"id":231,"text":"Using Knative, we will send data towards the Timescale database. Coming from an IoT world, protocols like MQTT and HTTP are much more common than \"SQL\". So we need to translate the data coming from our devices into SQL statements, and execute them against the Timescale database, using a PostgresSQL connection. We will perform the following steps: Set up a new project Create a Knative endpoint Costs Using Knative, we actually run user provided code. That is why it is pretty hard to create a \"free tier\" for a service like that. You could just mine bitcoins. So what we get is some free CPU time. Once we used that up, we will get charged. However, for a simple workshop like this, that is more than enough. And don’t forget that when you don’t use the service, it will idle and scale down to zero. Assuming we receive \"Cloud Events\", that is actually rather simple: take the data, make an SQL statement, execute. Assuming further we already know the data format, that is just a few lines of code. However, we cannot just run a few lines of code. We need some service, some infrastructure, some storage, …​ or, do we? That is where the \"serverless\" buzzword comes into play. We focus on the actual code of the translation. A serverless stack will take care of running this. Ideal for this case. Going even further, we adopt \"Knative\" and \"Knative eventing\", which is based on \"Cloud Events\". And with that, we know how we receive our events, in which envelope format we get the event. The payload is still specific to our device. Still, what we can do, is to tap into the Knative eventing ecosystem, and pick an existing image, which takes care of extracting information from a JSON based payload using JSONPath, and assembling an SQL statement for us. That comes in the form of an existing container image, and all that we need to do is to configure it, using environment variables. If you are curious, you can check out the code at: https://github.com/drogue-iot/drogue-postgresql-pusher So all that we need to do, is to configure a service to run an existing container for us. Using Knative we get scalability, scale-down to zero, monitoring, A/B deployments, and much more for free. We’ll provide you with two options on where you can run your Knative function: OpenShift developer sandbox - provides you with an quick getting started experience and a place where you can host your function up to 30 days for free IBM Cloud instance - also provides you a free tier to start with, but offer you an option to automatically convert to paying option if you wish to run your function for a longer period of time. In both cases we need to configure our function with appropriate environment variables. Variable name Value Description ENDPOINT__TOKEN Some random value you define and recall later The bearer token a caller needs to present in order to get access to the endpoint POSTGRESQL__CONNECTION__HOST Hostname portion from the psql connection URL The hostname of the TimescaleDB instance POSTGRESQL__CONNECTION__PORT Port portion from the psql connection URL The port of the TimescaleDB instance POSTGRESQL__CONNECTION__DBNAME tsdb The name of the database POSTGRESQL__CONNECTION__USER pusher The database user which has write-access POSTGRESQL__CONNECTION__PASSWORD The password you in the previous section for the pusher database user The password of the database user. POSTGRESQL__TABLE temperatures The name of the table POSTGRESQL__TIME_COLUMN time The name of the timestamp field FIELD_TEMPERATURE $.features.temperature.value The JSON path for extracting the temperature value from the actual payload TYPE_FIELD_TEMPERATURE float The data type of the temperature TAG_DEVICE_ID $.device The JSON path for extracting the device ID from the full event As we’ll see in the following section, these variables are configured differently with various providers, but the values are always the same. Now let’s dig into the hosting our function. For OpenShift, log into the console, select \"Administration\" view and navigate to the \"Serverless\" section Figure 1. Serverless section Now select the \"Serving\" menu and click on the Create > Service button. Here, you can enter the YAML definition of your function, with all necessary variables properly configured, like: apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1 kind: Service metadata: name: sample namespace: dejan-bosanac-dev spec: template: spec: containers: - image: ghcr.io/drogue-iot/postgresql-pusher:0.2.1 env: - name: ENDPOINT__TOKEN value: \"abcdef123456\" - name: POSTGRESQL__CONNECTION__HOST value: \"xxx.tsdb.cloud.timescale.com\" - name: POSTGRESQL__CONNECTION__PORT value: \"32740\" - name: POSTGRESQL__CONNECTION__DBNAME value: \"tsdb\" - name: POSTGRESQL__CONNECTION__USER value: \"pusher\" - name: POSTGRESQL__CONNECTION__PASSWORD value: \"pusher-password\" - name: POSTGRESQL__TABLE value: \"temperatures\" - name: POSTGRESQL__TIME_COLUMN value: \"time\" - name: FIELD_TEMPERATURE value: \"$.features.temperature.value\" - name: TYPE_FIELD_TEMPERATURE value: \"float\" - name: TAG_DEVICE_ID value: \"$.device\" After you create it, you’ll have your serverless function ready to use and you can copy its URL for future use. Figure 2. Service overview If you choose to use IBM Cloud instance, log in to your and navigate to the \"Code Engine\" module. On the right-hand side, open the \"Projects\" view. We will create a new project for this tutorial, so go ahead and press the Create button. On the creation page, select the location, and use drogue-iot as the project name: Figure 3. Project creation Project creation can take a while. Once it is ready, navigate to the project overview page and click on the Create application button: Figure 4. Project overview page Creating a new application, we need to provide a name (use pusher) and choose \"Container image\" as code to run. The image to use is ghcr.io/drogue-iot/postgresql-pusher:0.2.1. The \"listening port\" is 8080 and the endpoint must be \"Public\". In the \"Runtime settings\" section, configure the smallest instance you can find (e.g. \"0.125 vCPU / 0.25 GB\"). We will be running a process written in the Rust language, which is highly efficient and will not run into any limits. An important part is the section \"Environment variables\", as it will contain our configuration. Here we need to add function configuration by clicking on the Add button, using a \"Literal value\" entry. This should look something like this: Figure 5. Section of the create application page Finally, click on the Create button on the right-hand side, which will start the deployment process of the application. Once it is deployed correctly, the overview should look like this: Figure 6. Application configuration screen Take a look at the \"Endpoints\" tab, and note down the \"Public URL\", which we will need later on. We’ve set up the service which translates the device payload into SQL statements for TimescaleDB. However, currently no one is sending data to this endpoint. And as long as that is the case, the service will be scaled down to zero and not consume any resources, or cost any money. So, it is time to send some data to this endpoint.","title":"Knative","component":"drogue-workshops","version":"master","name":"knative","url":"/drogue-workshops/timeseries-as-a-service/knative.html","titles":[{"text":"What’s the plan?","hash":"_whats_the_plan","id":1},{"text":"OpenShift","hash":"_openshift","id":2},{"text":"IBM Cloud","hash":"_ibm_cloud","id":3},{"text":"Create a new project","hash":"_create_a_new_project","id":4},{"text":"Create application","hash":"_create_application","id":5},{"text":"What’s next?","hash":"_whats_next","id":6}]},"232":{"id":232,"text":"As we have an end-to-end IoT deployment now, we could use some more data. So, let’s generate some and see what we can do with it. Of course, you can set up a device and publish real data to the device you configured. However, explaining this may take some time, and we would like to keep this example focused on part of processing the data on the cloud side. Of course, if you already have some devices that you feel comfortable hooking up to Drogue Cloud, you can do that too. So, for this workshop we are using our device simulator. Clicking on the following link, will open the simulator in your browser. It will simulate a device using MQTT over websocket, and comes pre-configured with a sine wave generator, which generates an artificial temperature value. You will need to update the device credentials (application, device id, password) on the connection screen after loading. Click here: open simulator Update the credentials on the \"Connection\" page. Activate them by pressing the Apply button. Persisting configuration By default, all changes made to the simulator instance are temporary. Closing the browser tab will simply discard them. If you want to persist the changes, you can store one configuration as default. Navigate to the \"Configuration\" page, and click on the Set as default button. In order to let the simulator send data, you need to start the connection by pressing on the ▶ button in the top right navigation area. Once the simulator is connected, it will start sending data towards the system with a 250ms update period. You should also see the data coming in the Grafana dashboard. Keep the simulator running for a while, and don’t close the tab. Maybe grab a coffee and check out the data when you come back. Maybe also disconnect the simulator for a few minutes, and reconnect it afterwards, letting it push some more data (simulating a gap in the data too) Now that we have more data pushed to TimescaleDB, let’s focus on the dashboard query a bit. The current query we have in Grafana is a pretty basic one. Great to get started, but TimescaleDB can do way better. Let’s take a look at the following query: SELECT $__timeGroup(\"time\", $__interval, NULL), device_id as metric, avg(avg(temperature)) OVER w as temp FROM temperatures WHERE $__timeFilter(\"time\") AND device_id = ANY(ARRAY[$device_id]::varchar[]) GROUP BY time, device_id WINDOW w as (PARTITION BY device_id ORDER BY time RANGE '1 minute'::INTERVAL PRECEDING) ORDER BY time, device_id In a nutshell, this query takes the data, and builds a moving average over a time period of 1 minute. Partitioning the data by device, so that the moving average is build for each device, instead of over all devices. It will also not just skip gaps, but actively report them using NULL as value. This can be used in Grafana to make the user aware of the gaps, rather than just drawing a straight line. In addition to the existing query, add a new panel in the Grafana dashboard, using the query from above. Apply and save, and then take a look at the different visualization of the data: You can see that the measurement is much smoother now. Still, internally you have the actual, raw data available. Also, it is pretty easy to spot the gap in the data. In both variants. Bust just assume how that would look if the data would not be in such a predictable pattern. You might actually miss if the sensor value is a flat line, or if it was a gap in the data.","title":"Simulating data","component":"drogue-workshops","version":"master","name":"simulating-data","url":"/drogue-workshops/timeseries-as-a-service/simulating-data.html","titles":[{"text":"Device simulator","hash":"_device_simulator","id":1},{"text":"Update credentials","hash":"_update_credentials","id":2},{"text":"Start the connection","hash":"_start_the_connection","id":3},{"text":"Send data","hash":"_send_data","id":4},{"text":"Improving the dashboard query","hash":"_improving_the_dashboard_query","id":5}]},"233":{"id":233,"text":"With a few managed services, you can create an end-to-end IoT scenario.

This will include the following steps: Create a new instance Create a table Create two users for accessing the database Costs An instance will cost a certain amount of money per hour. The amount depends on the resources you consume. The \"bigger\" your database is planned to be, the more it will cost. However, you can test some tiers of Timescale free for 30 days. That is all that we need, and you can shut it down at ant time. And in the end, if the data is important to you, why not spend a few bucks on someone to take care of it. Navigate your browser to the Timescale Cloud, and create a new instance. Figure 1. Creation dialog The default settings will work just fine. Of course, you can tweak settings like \"Region\" to suit your needs. Just be sure that you do not add \"demo data\", as we don’t want to get this in our way. While the provisioning process is running, pay attention to the credentials section of the page: Figure 2. Credentials section It does contain the admin password for your instance. You will once see this once. Once you closed this page, you can reset the password, but not recover it. In order to connect, we will need to connect to the database using a PostgreSQL client. Simple get psql for your favorite operating system. Clicking on the \"How to connect\" button will open a dialog that will help you out with all the details. If you use Fedora, you can simply install the PostgreSQL client by running: sudo dnf install postgresql When you have psql installed, just copy the command and get connected: $ psql \"postgres://tsdbadmin@af4k0qkmbz.yo2nkz74j4.tsdb.cloud.timescale.com:37249/tsdb?sslmode=require\" Password for user tsdbadmin: (1) psql (13.4, server 13.6 (Ubuntu 13.6-1.pgdg21.04+1)) SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off) Type \"help\" for help. tsdb=> (2) 1 Enter your password here 2 Have fun with SQL You are connected to your database. Currently, it is empty, so follow along the next steps to add some content. First, we will create a new table, which will hold our temperature data per device. So we need: a device ID, a timestamp, and the actual value. All information is required. In SQL, that looks like this: CREATE TABLE temperatures ( time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL, device_id VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL, temperature DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL ); Go ahead and execute this using psql. You can just copy & paste it, or create a .sql file and run it instead. Using CREATE TABLE we created a simple PostgreSQL table. Nothing fancy, yet. As a next step, we will convert this table into a \"hypertable\", which is a table optimized for time-series data. This is where the power of Timescale on top of PostgreSQL comes into play. Execute the following statement: SELECT create_hypertable('temperatures', 'time'); Pretty simple. There is a lot more to it, you can learn more about hypertables from the TimescaleDB documentation. Of course, we don’t want to use the \"admin\" user with the different services which need access to the database. So we will create two users: one for writing data, one for reading data. Just as you would do with a normal database: CREATE USER pusher WITH PASSWORD 'pusher-password'; GRANT INSERT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO pusher; CREATE USER dashboard WITH PASSWORD 'dashboard-password'; GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO dashboard; Choose reasonably secure passwords. Just ensure that you recall them later on. So we created a new database and table for our time-series data. We created users and granted permissions. The database is ready to be used.

Of course, in the background, TimescaleDB knows how to best optimize the data and queries. By transforming the standard table into a \"hypertable\" earlier on, we allowed the database to create chunks of data, grouped by time. When building a Grafana dashboard, showing the last 30 minutes of data, some chunks might not even be touched when collecting the data. However, we can do even better. Remember that we allow the user to filter by device, and also used the \"device id\" when partitioning the data for the moving average. We could add the device ID as an additional portioning dimension. Execute the following statement using the psql tool: CREATE TABLE temperatures2 ( time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL, device_id VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL, temperature DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL ); SELECT create_hypertable('temperatures2', 'time', partitioning_column => 'device_id', number_partitions => 3); INSERT INTO temperatures2 (SELECT * FROM temperatures); -- now swap tables ALTER TABLE temperatures RENAME TO temperatures_old; ALTER TABLE temperatures2 RENAME TO temperatures; DROP TABLE temperatures_old; GRANT INSERT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO pusher; GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO dashboard; CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW temperature_summary_minute WITH (timescaledb.continuous) AS SELECT time_bucket_gapfill(INTERVAL '1 minute', time, NULL) AS ts, device_id, AVG(temperature) as temperature FROM temperatures GROUP BY ts, device_id; SELECT add_continuous_aggregate_policy('temperature_summary_minute', start_offset => INTERVAL '1 month', end_offset => INTERVAL '1 minute', schedule_interval => INTERVAL '1 minute'); GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO dashboard; DROP MATERIALIZE VIEW temperature_summary_minute; SELECT ts, metric, avg(temp) FROM ( SELECT time_bucket('10s',\"time\") AS ts, device_id as metric, avg(avg(temperature)) OVER w as temp FROM temperatures WHERE \"time\" BETWEEN now() - INTERVAL '5m' AND NOW() AND device_id = 'device1' GROUP BY ts, time, device_id WINDOW w as (PARTITION BY device_id ORDER BY time RANGE '1 minute'::INTERVAL PRECEDING) ORDER BY ts, device_id ) grouped_temps GROUP BY ts, metric ;","title":"Wait, there is more!","component":"drogue-workshops","version":"master","name":"wait-there-is-more","url":"/drogue-workshops/timeseries-as-a-service/wait-there-is-more.html","titles":[{"text":"Generating data","hash":"_generating_data","id":1},{"text":"Update credentials","hash":"_update_credentials","id":2},{"text":"Start the connection","hash":"_start_the_connection","id":3},{"text":"Send data","hash":"_send_data","id":4},{"text":"Improving the dashboard query","hash":"_improving_the_dashboard_query","id":5},{"text":"Better partitioning","hash":"_better_partitioning","id":6},{"text":"Materializing queries","hash":"_materializing_queries","id":7},{"text":"Just testing","hash":"_just_testing","id":8}]},"236":{"id":236,"text":"The step will guide you through the setup of your TTN (v3) account.

Instead of implementing all the LoRa infrastructure ourselves, we re-use the infrastructure of The Things Network (TTN). However, we will want to process the data as part of our Drogue Cloud setup. This workshop requires additional hardware, as we need an embedded device with a LoRa modem. Additionally to the common pre-requisites, you will need: A Drogue Device supported development board and LoRa modem Coverage for \"The Things Network\" A \"The Things Network\" v3 account A publicly accessible Drogue IoT Cloud instance running version 0.5+ Standard Java development tools: Java, Maven, Git Ideally, you have the STM32L0 discovery kit for LoRa (B-L072Z-LRWAN1). This kit has a Drogue Device supported STM32 board, and also has an SX1276 modem, for which Drogue Device has a LoRa driver. You may also use a different Drogue Device supported board, adding the SX1276 using SPI. However, this means that you need to adapt the provided example firmware yourself. You can think of TTN as your LoRa network provider. When your device wants to send over the TTN LoRa network, you need to ensure that you have network coverage. So you can check if your region is already covered. The good thing with TTN is, if your region is not covered, you can take care of this yourself. For this you will need to buy (or lend) a LoRa gateway. The LoRa gateway will open a local LoRa network cell, and connect via TCP/IP to the TTN LoRa network backend. LoRa gateways come in various flavors. You can build one yourself with a Raspberry Pi, you can go all-in and buy an industrial, rugged version, mounting this to your roof and cover some km² with LoRa. Or, you can go on the cheap side and simply buy the The Things Indoor Gateway (TTIG). This time, you cannot run Drogue Cloud on your local machine. The Things Network will need to reach out to your machine, in order to deliver events to Drouge Cloud.

However, we need to be careful: LoRaWAN isn’t intended to constantly send data. First of all, the usage policy restricts you from doing so. Second, this is bad for power consumption and thus for the battery. The Things Network limits downlink messages to a few per day. So we also cannot always send a downlink message, like we currently do it, when the button is pressed. Here is what we need to change: The device needs to report the state of the LED to the cloud too. The device needs to periodically phone home The cloud side application needs to evaluate if the state of the device’s LED is in the desired state. If not, it needs to send out a command to the device to alter its state, but only in this case. Let prepare the cloud side first. All that we need to do is to change the Processor class: // first we split the payload var parts = event.getPayload().split(\",\"); // then we check if the payload is, what we expect... if (parts.length != 2 || !parts[0].startsWith(\"ping:\") || !parts[1].startsWith(\"led:\")) { // .. if not, return with no command return null; } // check if the configured response is about the LED, and if it matches ... if (!this.response.startsWith(\"led:\") || parts[1].equals(this.response)) { // ... it is not, or it matches, so we return with no command return null; } // if we end up here, we need to update the device LOG.info(\"Need to update device state\"); On the device side, we need to add a ticker. Take a look at the file main.rs, and make the following changes: use drogue_device::{ actors::button::*, actors::ticker::*, (1) drivers::led::*, drivers::lora::sx127x::*, … } use embassy::time::Duration; (2) 1 Import the ticker actor. 2 Import the Duration struct. #[derive(Device)] pub struct MyDevice { lora: ActorContext>>, button: ActorContext>>, MyApp>>, app: ActorContext, ticker: ActorContext>, (1) } 1 Add an actor context for the ticker Next, initialize the ticker for the device: context.configure(MyDevice { app: ActorContext::new(App::new(AppInitConfig { tx_led: led2, green_led: led1, init_led: led4, user_led: led3, lora: Some(config), })), lora: ActorContext::new(LoraActor::new(lora)), button: ActorContext::new(Button::new(pin)), ticker: ActorContext::new(Ticker::new(Duration::from_secs(60), Command::Send)), (1) }); 1 Add the ticker, and configure it so send the Command::Send event every 60 seconds. Now that the ticker takes care of sending the uplink message, we need to decouple this from the button push event. In the file app.rs, make the following changes: fn from(event: ButtonEvent) -> Option { match event { ButtonEvent::Pressed => None, ButtonEvent::Released => Some(Command::Tick), (1) } } 1 When the button is released, send Command::Tick only. Next, we change the context which is sent to the cloud. We simply append the LED state at the end of the current message: let mut tx = String::::new(); let led = match self.config.user_led.state().unwrap_or_default() { true => \"on\", false => \"off\", }; (1) write!(&mut tx, \"ping:{},led:{}\", self.counter, led).ok(); (2) log::info!(\"Message: {}\", &tx); let tx = tx.into_bytes(); 1 Generate the current state as a string. 2 Append the string to uplink message, using the prefix led:. After making those changes, you should be able to compile and flash the firmware again using: cargo run --release Pretty easy, wasn’t it? Noticed the bit of string handling on device side. And still, we are 100% sure we didn’t create any memory leaks or invalid pointer access in the process thanks to Rust. So after the device is flashed, let’s sit back and watch the device phone home. Make some change to the LED state, and watch the logs. The LED should change. But, you only see the message Need to update device state in the logs, when there was a mismatch between the actual and the desired state of the LED. Now it is time to come up with your own ideas. You could: Switch from sending string to some binary format, to make your LoRa messages more efficient. You could come up with some more elaborate processing on the cloud side. Maybe tie in some external service for evaluating the desired state of the LED. Attach a sensor to the device, and send some real data. 1.

The application that wants to talk to the device, in order to provide some value-add. For implementing this, we choose Quarkus. Java is great for business applications, there are plenty of tutorials on how to build and interface Quarkus application with enterprise systems. So in this workshop, we will focus on bridging the gap between enterprise and IoT. The core idea here is that you use Drogue IoT cloud as a service. That means, we don’t plan on deploying our application inside the same cluster, but on a separate machine or cluster. Technically you can still do that! We just try to follow a more \"as-a-service\" approach, and you might see in a minute, that this also makes things easier, as you can run the application in your local machine, use our sandbox, and still be connected to the public TTN network. We will be using the MQTT integration of Drogue IoT. This makes things easy, as we don’t need to bridge two Kafka clusters, and still can have multiple consumers. Also, it is possible to just re-use all your tools around MQTT that you already may know about, for testing and debugging. In order to get access to the application through the MQTT integration, we need an OAuth token or API token. As you need to periodically refresh an OAuth token, and most MQTT clients have no idea about that, we choose an API token here[1]. Getting a new API token currently requires to use a command line HTTP client, like HTTPie or curl. It is a simple operation though, and we will use drg whoami --token to acquire a fresh OAuth token for accessing the API. The following examples require you to replace with the actual API endpoint. You can get this from the web console, from the page named \"Home\": The API endpoint URL is located in the box \"API\" in the \"Services\" column. The following examples will use the command jq to pretty-format that the JSON result of the commands. If can’t use jq, you can also omit it as is it only used to improve readability of the result. curl -vs -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(drg whoami --token)\" -XPOST /api/tokens/v1alpha1 | jq The output should look something like: { \"prefix\": \"drg_g0yAUq\", \"token\": \"drg_g0yAUq_kwjRLA40hrt81bbKdGbcDOmlq2WASx6UyQi\" } The value of the field token is the actual API token. You will not be able to recover this token at a later time. So you need to note (copy) it somewhere. The \"prefix\" is used to identity the token, so that you can easily delete it later on. You can also list your existing API tokens using: curl -s -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(drg whoami --token)\" /api/tokens/v1alpha1 | jq Which should provide you can output like: [ { \"prefix\": \"drg_g0yAUq\", \"created\": \"2021-04-28T08:42:59.336402353Z\" } ] As you can see, the actual token is no longer part of the result. If you need to delete a token, you can easily achieve this using the DELETE verb: curl -s -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(drg whoami --token)\" -XDELETE /api/tokens/v1alpha1/drg_g0yAUq In addition to the API token, you will also need to know your username. You can check your username using the Web Console. In the top right corner of the console, you will find the user menu, which shows you your username: While we provide a ready to run container of this application, this workshop plans to make changes to the source code. While all the following steps are possible without an IDE, you may wish to set up of your favorite IDE alongside the process. The tutorial doesn’t require any IDE specific settings or tasks, everything could be done using plain Maven and the most basic text editor. But, feel free to make yourself comfortable. We will start directly by cloning the source code of this example, and run it locally: git clone https://github.com/drogue-iot/quarkus-mqtt-integration-example Next, we need to insert the parameters for connecting the application to the MQTT integration: Create the file src/main/resources/application-dev.properties and add the following content: drogue.application.name=my-app (1) drogue.api.user=my-username (2) drogue.api.key=drg_g0yAUq_3z5pasdcasdeI4YqOP123hdsa821VAtFs4x (3) drogue.integration.mqtt.host=mqtt-integration.sandbox.drogue.cloud (4) drogue.integration.mqtt.port=443 (5) 1 The Drogue IoT application name 2 Your Drogue IoT username, as described in Finding your username 3 Your Drogue IoT application token, as described in Create a new API token 4 The hostname of the MQTT integration. 5 The port number of the MQTT integration. While 443 might look strange here for MQTT, it will still work in the case of OpenShift, as OpenShift routes patch through TLS based TCP connections directly through to the endpoint.

Navigate your browser to the web console, as shows in the previous step’s log output. It should look something like: Once you press the blue button on the board, you should see an incoming message, and with that, an outgoing message too. Try changing the response to led:on, and press the blue button again. The blue LED on the board should turn on, once the green, send indicator, LED turns off again. It may be that the blue LED doesn’t turn on. Give it a second try, by pressing the blue button again. Why is that needed? A short period after the uplink (device-to-cloud) message, the LoRa device switches into receive mode, awaiting an optional downlink (cloud-to-device) message. If that time window is missed, then the device will not receive the downlink message, and go back to sleep. We will deal with this later, so read on. Let’s take a quick tour through the code. The main logic is in class io.drogue.iot.demo.Processor, and it is actually pretty simple: @Incoming(\"event-stream\") (1) @Outgoing(\"device-commands\") (2) @Broadcast (3) public DeviceCommand process(DeviceEvent event) { var payload = event.getPayload(); LOG.info(\"Received payload: {}\", payload); if (!event.getPayload().startsWith(\"ping:\")) { return null; } var command = new DeviceCommand(); command.setDeviceId(event.getDeviceId()); command.setPayload(this.response.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)); return command; (4) } 1 Annotation for consuming messages from the event-stream channel. 2 Annotation for delivering messages, coming out of this method, to the device-commands channel. 3 Indication that all consumers of the device-commands channel should receive the event. This is required so that all browsers that are attached to the web frontend, and the device will receive the event. 4 The actual message we generated and want to send out. The processing part already expects messages of the type DeviceEvent. This is an application specific Java message, which we don’t send out in Drogue cloud. The conversion takes place in the class io.drogue.iot.demo.integration.Receiver. It will take the incoming MQTT message, which is a Cloud Events message in structured content mode, as with Quarkus, we are using MQTT v3. We decode the data section as a JSON encoded TTN uplink message, and extract the payload from it. As with the Processor class before, the return the processed (converted) message. The returned message will be sent to the event-stream, so that both the Processor and any attached web browser will receive it. The output of the Processor will be received by the io.drogue.iot.demo.integration.Sender class. This class will construct the MQTT message, which contains the command for the device. It will publish this as an MQTT message, which will then be forwarded by Drogue cloud to the command endpoint for the device. Which in our case here is the downlink API of The Things Network. 1. API tokens don’t expire, while OAuth access tokens do. Even when you can refresh an access token using a refresh token, you still need to do this.","title":"Quarkus application","component":"drogue-workshops","version":"master","name":"quarkus-application","url":"/drogue-workshops/ttn-lorawan-quarkus/quarkus-application.html","titles":[{"text":"Creating a Drogue IoT cloud API token","hash":"_creating_a_drogue_iot_cloud_api_token","id":1},{"text":"Create a new API token","hash":"_create_a_new_api_token","id":2},{"text":"List API tokens","hash":"_list_api_tokens","id":3},{"text":"Deleting API tokens","hash":"_deleting_api_tokens","id":4},{"text":"Finding your username","hash":"_finding_your_username","id":5},{"text":"Preparing the application","hash":"_preparing_the_application","id":6},{"text":"Testing the setup","hash":"_testing_the_setup","id":7},{"text":"Testing it out","hash":"_testing_it_out","id":8},{"text":"Understanding the code","hash":"_understanding_the_code","id":9},{"text":"Processing","hash":"_processing","id":10},{"text":"Receiving events","hash":"_receiving_events","id":11},{"text":"Sending commands","hash":"_sending_commands","id":12}]},"243":{"id":243,"text":"In order to create a device firmware, you will need to set up an embedded toolchain for Rust.

We’ve seen how you can use a WiFi-enabled microcontroller with a temperature sensor to send temperature data to Drogue Cloud, using the already available sandbox. After making sure the telemetry events arrived at the cloud, we ran a simple WebAssembly application to demonstrate how you can consume events from Drogue Cloud websockets, using the publicly available drogue-public-temperature application available on the sandbox. We then saw how you tap into the Websocket event stream and forward it to another data store used by Grafana to build a more powerful dashboard for long term monitoring of the telemetry data. With the end to end setup complete, you can adopt the architecture to your specific use case and go on from there. Some examples: Make Websocket example use your application instead of using drogue-public-temperature Add more devices and more sensor data to the mix Modify the device firmware to accept commands and send commands using the command API On our side, the current Grafana example is just a first step in providing easy getting started telemetry application for Drogue Cloud. While it works nicely in the scenario we covered, there are a lot more we can improve upon: Provide more integration options - current implementation supports only web sockets. We’d like to provide more connectivity options (MQTT and Kafka) and more resilience to connection handling Run in serverless environment - Many cloud environments, like Openshift developer sandbox provide Servlerless/Knative support for its users. We should leverage it when we can and provide seamless integration.

In addition to the actual toolchain, you will need tools to flash the firmware to your device, and to monitor what is going on. There are a few tools for Rust which can help here. However, we will focus on the probe-run. You can install probe-run be executing the following command: cargo install probe-run Make sure you properly set up probe, like for example set udev rules on Linux to allow users without root privileges access to the debug probes as well.","title":"Toolchain setup","component":"drogue-workshops","version":"master","name":"toolchain","url":"/drogue-workshops/wifi-websockets/toolchain.html","titles":[{"text":"Install rustup","hash":"_install_rustup","id":1},{"text":"Install an embedded toolchain","hash":"_install_an_embedded_toolchain","id":2},{"text":"Additional tools","hash":"_additional_tools","id":3}]},"251":{"id":251,"text":"Now that we have events flowing into Drogue Cloud, it’s time to visualize the data.

You can use a pre-running instance of this application at https://drogue-iot.github.io/wasm-websocket-integration-example. Read on if you want to run this application locally as well: Clone the git repository with the integration example: git clone https://github.com/drogue-iot/wasm-websocket-integration-example For the next steps, make sure you have npm installed as listed in the prerequisites. To build the WASM application and test it locally, we need the trunk tool: cargo install trunk To build the application, we must first install the dependencies: npm install Once installed, we can build and run the main application locally: trunk serve --port 8080 Open your browser at http://localhost:8080, and you should see the temperature dashboard: You can adjust the URL in the text field, but for this workshop you can just use the default URL. Click Connect to start plotting temperature data.
